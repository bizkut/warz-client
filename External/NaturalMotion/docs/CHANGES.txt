This is version 5.2 of morpheme:runtime

5.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue with the LiveLinkNetworkPreview tutorial which prevented any more than a single new network
  instance being sent to the target.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue when compiling partial animations with the QSA animation format. The common root bone needs
  to be a valid animation channel.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a crash when there are zero arms or legs in a euphoria rig.
- Visual Studio 2010 projects can now be seamlessly upgraded to Visual Studio 2012. See UPGRADE.txt.
- Removed the copyPhysX3Dlls batch files. Moved xcopy directly into post build step. Makes upgrading to newer versions
  of Visual Studio easier.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an asset compiler crash when setting a start state when using a prediction model.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a crash when compiling animations by enforcing that there are exactly the required number of
  quantisation sets (in some circumstances the compounder could generate fewer than the requested number of sets).
- [BUG FIX, HOTFIX-12] The euphoria runtime no longer crashes when there are invalid bones in the root node's transform
  buffer between the interaction proxy and the character root.  The bind pose is used for any missing channels.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed bugs that could cause physically simulated characters (typically ragdolls, but other simulation
  methods too) to either not sleep when they should be able to, or to sleep when sleeping should be disabled.
- NMP::RingBuffer class updated. New functions: create, locate, dislocate, getNumActiveEntries, getMaxNumEntries. push
  and pop functions replaced with pushHead, forcePushHead, popTail, popHead. getReadItem function replaced with
  getNthEntryFromHead and getNthEntryFromTail. empty function replaced with isEmpty. full function replaced with isFull.
- New OperatorTimeLagInput node allows delayed output of control parameter input values, by buffering the input.
  Supports float, int, bool, vector3 and quat. It has 2 outputs, a delayed output pin and a pass through that allows the
  operator to be updated (buffering continues) even when the delayed output pin is not active. Also supports either
  fixed time sampling of the input or recording of every frames input. This allows for a trade off between recoding
  accuracy and memory requirements.
- PC Asset Compilers in release will dump callstack info to the error log in the event of a crash.

5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The default value for MAX_NUM_DURATION_EVENTS has been increased from 64 to 128.
- The sum of the twist in all the joints in a limb can be measured using the calculateLimbTwist member function on
  erLimb.
- Added RuntimeSimple_Euphoria tutorial.
- Limb IK can now be switched into a non-incremental mode which may reduce performance. This mode is only used by the
  aim behaviour when the supporting arm is twisted.
- Asset compiler configuration files are now stored in the runtime zip in \morpheme\tools\assetCompiler\configs. 
  Building the asset compiler will copy them to the output bin directory as a post-build step.
- New node: Modify Joint Transform. Allows setting or adding to a joints transform, either in local, character or world
  space.
- New node: Modify Trajectory Transform. Allows setting or adding to the delta trajectory transform of the current
  frame. This affects the root movement of the character.
- Added a MR_CIRCDEPS_DEBUGGING define for debugging potential circular task dependencies in networks.
- [BUG FIX] Corrected BlendOpsBase::interpQuatAddPosPartialFeathered to include previously ignored boneAlphaScale in its
  position interpolation and corrected BlendOpsBase::interpQuatAddPosPartial to included alpha clamping there. Also
  added alpha clamping to align BlendOpsSIMD functions interpQuatAddPosPartial, interpQuatSubtractPosPartial and
  subtractQuatInterpPosPartial with their BlendOpsBase equivalents.
- The NMP socket implementation is now inside the NMP namespace.  This prevents it conflicting with other
  implementations of POSIX socket API.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed and assert that was firing in some blend node configurations, particularly when transitioning in or
  out of non looping animations.
- [BUG FIX] CharacterEuphoria::updatePrePhysics was not applying cached physics rig channel data to the physics engine
  for physics, but non euphoria, characters.
- Corrected function name spelling: renamed CharacterManager isCharacterDefRegisterd to isCharacterDefRegistered.
- Changes to the InteractionProxy initialisation/update - see UPGRADE.txt.
- [BUG FIX] Floating point accuracy error occurring in calcCurrentPlaybackValuesFromParentDeltaTimeAdjSpace corrected.
  No longer breaks playback pos if the delta update is 0.
- [BUG FIX] Output Control parameters no longer have a 1 frame delay. They are now updated at the end of the morpheme
  update and are consistent with the current frame number for game logic.
- Aim behaviour interface now outputs an effective aim direction for the chest and pelvis instead of an effective pose
  target.
- Allow setting a handler for PhysX articulation explosions.
- [BUG FIX] Removed non-existent and invalid projects from the PhysX3 tutorial solutions.
- New OperatorBoolean node performs boolean logic on up to 6 inputs. Located in the Scalar Operators node palette tab.
- New OperatorCompare node performs logical comparison between 2 inputs or between an input and a constant. Supported
  types for comparison are float, int and uint. Located in the Scalar Operators node palette tab.
- [BUG FIX] Mirror node now correctly mirrors sync event tracks, so the resulting event durations are now correct.
- Game::Character m_name changed to a pointer so that the class size is constant between debug and release.
- Simplified update of Game characters, by changing the way that overriding the delta translation is done.
- Removed unnecessary updateInit step from Game::CharacterControllerPhysX2.
- Sampled event blending options added for Blend2, FeatherBlend and SubtractiveBlend. In the 'Blending' section there is
  now an 'Events' field. This can be either 'Merge' or 'Add'. 'Merge' is the previous behaviour (the sampled events
  weights being multiplied by blend weight. source 0 x (1-blend weight), source 1 x blend weight). 'Add' keeps the
  sampled event weight of source 0 unmodified and source 1 is multiplied by blend weight as before.
- Do not produce animations nor create attrib data for animation sets that cannot be reached. This occurs through use of
  the Retarget node. Custom nodes that require the same functionality should add the code for their node type into the
  getNodeValidAnimSets() function in the NetworkDefBuilder class in the asset compiler.
- Removed state names from the m_nodeIDNamesTable string table used primarily in the function
  getNodeIDFromNodeName("Name"). See UPGRADE.TXT.

5.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed runtime crashes when using hinge joints with PhysX 3.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed problem where the swing1 and swing2 limits could get flipped with jointed PhysX 3 rigs.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a failure to update connections in networks with two active BlendAll nodes.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a crash bug in the Morpheme PhysX 3 runtime target when using Z-up assets.
- Added an NM_COMPILER_LLVM define. Previously, LLVM compilers were identified as GCC in the runtime code.
- Removed MR_TASKID_BASIC_UNEVEN_TERRAIN_TRAJECTORY_DELTA_AND_TRANSFORMS, MR_TASKID_PREDICTIVE_UNEVEN_TERRAIN_TRANSFORMS
  and MR_TASKID_PREDICTIVE_UNEVEN_TERRAIN_TRAJECTORY_DELTA_AND_TRANSFORMS as they all refer to the same task as
  MR_TASKID_BASIC_UNEVEN_TERRAIN_TRANSFORMS.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed problem blending duration event tracks when the number of sync events in the sources are not multiples
  of each other.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a maths issue in QuatMP::logAtan2 which could cause animation artifacts when using the QSA animation
  format.
- [BUG FIX] The ScaleCharacter node will no longer assert/crash if you send messages to it while the node is inactive.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue where the limitContactDistance on a joint limit can be larger than the limit range, causing
  validation failures in PhysX.
- [BUG FIX] m_combinedTrajectoryAndTransforms was not being initialised on a call to Network::init.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed crash where an UnevenTerrain node (Predictive or Basic) was downstream (toward children) of certain
  physics nodes (Active Animation, Ragdoll, Local Soft Key Frame).
- As a result of the above bug fix; when an UnevenTerrain node is downstream of either an Active Animation, Ragdoll,
  Local Soft Key Frame node, the root control method changes from ROOT_CONTROL_PHYSICS to
  ROOT_CONTROL_PHYSICAL_ANIMATION.

5.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] The ApplyPhysicsJointLimit node now functions by itself without needing any additional physics node.
- [BUG FIX] Transit messages now reset on the transition and its destination on the conclusion of the transition.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue with the LiveLinkNetworkPreview runtime tutorial that prevented network def data being sent
  dynamically to the runtime.

5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- All node builders can now declare data pins as having attribute data specified in Connect, optionally per animation
  set. Any such attribute data defined for a control parameter of a node is stored in a non-visible output pin of the
  same node. This allows the runtime to operate as before whether the input data for a control parameter comes from a
  connected pin or such a specified attribute data.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed Blend2 and FeatherBlend2 initTaskQueuingFnsEvents() so they correctly always queue tasks to generate
  sync and duration event tracks when event matching.
- The DefaultDataManager::getNodeOutputData and DefaultRuntime::getNodeOutputData methods now correctly return false if
  there is no attrib data to be retrieved.
- [BUG FIX] The target of a self transition is reset.
- Dependencies/lib/includes in build files are now in dependency order across all platforms.
- Static libraries now have project references explicitly set up in vcxproj files.
- [BUG FIX] Changed the comparison of the hashed names in the Asset Compiler to prevent false positives.
- [BUG FIX] The transition condition "in duration event" was returning a false positive in certain cases when "true if
  not set" was selected.
- [BUG FIX] The buffer for sampled events was mistakenly being sized based on MAX_NUM_FOUND_EVENTS and
  MAX_NUM_SAMPLED_TRACKS. It now uses MAX_NUM_FOUND_EVENTS and MAX_NUM_DURATION_EVENTS.
- Refactored MR::BlendOpsBase::accumulateTransforms to only handle full transform buffers. Its consideration for
  non-full transform buffers was inefficient and redundant because of the existence of accumulateTransformsPartial.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an assert/crash from improper testing of nodes becoming active the frame after being deleted.
- [HOTFIX-8] Subtractive blend node now supports event passthrough.
- [HOTFIX-10] Fixed integer overflow bug and performance issue while compressing animations with large numbers of bones.
- Operator nodes are now updated for a specific anim set. Network::updateOutputCPAttribute now takes an AnimSetIndex
  parameter.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed up the Blend2 node so that it now correctly samples events when passing through on source 0 or 1 but
  not time stretching.
- Rename MR::GameGroup enum members: GROUP_CAPSULE_CONTROLLER to GROUP_CHARACTER_CONTROLLER,  GROUP_CHARACTERS to 
  GROUP_CHARACTER_PART, GROUP_PROXY_CHARACTER to GROUP_INTERACTION_PROXY.
- Temporarily removed the Node Wizard until it has been updated to reflect recent runtime changes.
- Prediction models now support resample maps to perform fast inverse queries from analysis properties to control
  parameters.
- Added support for zero dimension prediction models.
- Removed unused member m_modifyTime from MR::AnimSourceBase.
- Rename for clarity NMP::DataBuffer.copy(const Memory::Resource& resource) to NMP::DataBuffer.copyTo(const
  Memory::Resource& resource).
- Rename for clarity NMP::DataBuffer.copy(DataBuffer* destBuffer) to NMP::DataBuffer.copyTo(DataBuffer* destBuffer).
- [BUG FIX] Prevent duplicate activePhysicsNodeIDs and activeGrouperNodeIDs being stored within the Network.
- [BUG FIX] Address a buffer overrun issue in NMP_STRCAT_S and NMP_STRCPY_S; also renamed these to NMP_STRNCAT_S and
  NMP_STRNCPY_S.
- [BUG FIX] OperatorRampFloat the "Start" value is no longer ignored.
- OperatorRampFloat modified so that the internal float value is no longer clamped with Clamping enabled only the
  output.
- [BUG FIX] Added a NODE_FLAG_NO_PHYSICAL_CHILDREN to optimise the performance of isNodeOrChildPhysical (note that this
  API has been renamed, see upgrade.txt).
- [BUG FIX] Fixed up TransitConditionDefControlParamIntInRange and TransitConditionDefControlParamUIntInRange to
  correctly use the m_invert flag.

4.1.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue where the FastHeapAllocator would crash when NMP_MEMORY_LOGGING was enabled.

4.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Multithreaded tutorials occasional asserts because of unsafe access to shared management components.
- [BUG FIX] Animations for PS3 are compiled with smaller section sizes than for other platforms, but this was not taken
  account of in the anim cache. Adding a maxSectionSize to the anim cache key has fixed the problem. Note that this
  prevents use of old cache formats with the new AssetCompiler.
- [BUG FIX] Active state transitions not triggering correctly from some of the specified sources.
- Refactored the UniformQuantisationInfoCompounder so that it doesn't maintain a matrix of costs for the joints. This
  was requesting extremely large amounts of memory for rigs with high bone counts.
- Added a utility function for the ScaleCharacter node to make it easier to generate scale character messages.
- Expanded the livelink runtimeTargetInterface with getNodeTagCount and getNodeTag functions.  These functions must be
  added to your live link integration if not using the simpleDataManager.
- Added getNumTagsOnNode and getTagOnNode functions to the NodeTagTable.
- Added StrideLength and EulerAngleComponent analysis property types.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed issues with ScatterBlend1D which meant that it was always being analysed with 1 sub-division level.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed issues with ScatterBlend1D for analysing angular properties that wrap the -pi:pi range.
- Added a new TempMemoryAllocator interface class.  This class abstracts FastHeapAllocator away from the morpheme API,
  allowing applications to replace FastHeapAllocator with another allocator which implements the TempMemoryAllocator
  interface. Instead of using the implementation-specific get/setCurrentPointer system to perform roll-backs of
  allocated memory, the TempMemoryAllocator interface provides a mechanism to create and destroy child allocators.
- Added gameManagement library which provides an example of how morpheme might be integrated in to a game. Tutorials use
  this library rather than TutorialManagement. This library provides an easy start point to getting morpheme up and
  running in your application. There are physics and no physics versions of this library.
- [BUG FIX] Fix for dead reckoning in dead blends to animation.

4.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Dead blend transitions that were initialised with a zero delta time (at Network initialisation for example)
  could cause a division by zero in initialiseDeadBlendSeparateTransformsAndTrajectory.
- Removed AssetExporter and NodeWizard binaries from source zip.
- Reduced the size of size of NMRU::FKRetarget::PerJointParams by 16 bytes.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed mass modification of hard keyframed parts which was causing jitter in partial body physics.

4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Main runtime tutorials now link against tutorialManagement library.
- Allow PhysX2 users to specify whether the runtime target uses a fixed or variable timestep.
- [BUG FIX] Made vpu::mask4i safe for processor modes flushing denormals to zero.
- NMP memory allocation functions no longer need NMP_MEMORY_TRACKING_ARGS specified for memory logging.
- Added priorities to transitions.
- In transitGenerateFirstFrameTimeValues and transitDeadBlendGenerateFirstFrameTimeValues switched the order of
  conditions so that; if (transitDef->m_destinationInitMethod ==
  AttribDataTransitDef::INIT_DEST_USE_START_DURATION_FRACTION), comes before; else if (!destSyncEventTrack), so that we
  don't unnecessarily output warnings. the; else if (!destSyncEventTrack), case outputs a warning in both functions now.
- When applying a Network restore point retain any StateMachineAttribData state change callbacks that already exist on
  the destination network. This is because we cannot reliably store function pointers in a NetworkRestorePoint.
- [BUG FIX] AttribDataStateMachine::relocate would not function correctly if the AttribDataStateMachineDef was not in
  the same location as at creation time. Removed registered relocate function from AttribDataStateMachine. Added
  specialist locate and relocate functions to AttribDataStateMachine that take the NetworkDef* as a reference.
- Add a way for the Asset Compiler to return fail, without asserting in debug. Added a m_processingFailFlag to the
  AssetProcessor. If any stage of asset processing sets this flag the asset compiler will return an error code from its
  execution.
- Stopped AssetProcessor::processAsset from pointlessly returning a bool that was always set to true.
- [BUG FIX] Removed ASSERT in nodeStateMachineDeleteInstance that could actually fire under legitimate circumstances.
- [BUG FIX] Breakout transitions from ActiveState node could crash runtime. Breakout self transition was being detected,
  but not flagged correctly so that the calling function could deal with it.
- [BUG FIX] CharacterControllerDef::setSkinWidth() was not storing the value passed in, due to a name shadowing bug.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a memory leak in NodeStateMachineBuilder.cpp.
- DISPATCHER_TASK_MAX has been removed.  There is now no limit to the number of tasks you can register with a
  Dispatcher.  See UPGRADE.TXT for more info.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed variable naming confusion between useDeadBlend and useDeadReckoning in mrTransitDeadBlend.inl.
- [BUG FIX] There was not enough memory being allocated for AttribDataDurationEventTrackSet in some circumstances.
- Platform-specific NMPlatform implementation details are now abstracted into separate files.  Added NMHost.h for each
  platform.
- Added NM_HOST_64_BIT to denote that the host platform is 64-bit (e.g. Windows x64).
- Renamed XMDPluginFBX asset compiler library to acFBX.
- Moved copying of PhysX dlls in morphemePhysicsDriver_PhysX3 from the pre build step into a batch file called from the
  pre build step and use xcopy.
- Added MCN_PATH macro to the AssetExporter.
- Removed the owning node parameter from MR::Network::TaskAddXXXOutput functions to make it explicit that a node can
  only output its own data.
- Moved the creation of MR::AttribData from task execution to a new stage between task queuing and task execution.
- Factored out some member functions previously in MR::Network into MR::NodeBin.
- Changed typedef TransitCondInstanceUpdateFn to now return a bool indicating if the condition is true or not.
- Improved the update of State Machine Conditions.
- Added typedefs for StateID, ConditionIndex, MessageID. Note that these are uint16_t as opposed to previous uint32_t.
- New NMP::Flags function: isSet avoids a load hit stall when checking if a single flag is set (majority use).
- [BUG FIX] Binary invariance caused by unfixing NULL pointers.
- Changed typedef for DeleteNodeInstance so that the node ptr parameter is const i.e. const NodeDef* node.
- Moved large functions and a large list of includes from mrNodes.h to mrNodes.cpp.
- Added Character Controller Override node to allow the network to influence the character controller.
- Removed ControllerHeightFraction and ControllerRadiusFraction from SoftKeyFrame, HardKeyFrame and
  SoftKeyFrameAndActiveAnimation nodes. Use the Character Controller Override node instead.
- Added an m_invert flag to the condition base class, and removed equivalent flag from
  TransitConditionDefControlParamFloatInRange, TransitConditionDefInDurationEvent, TransitConditionDefOnMessage.
- Made TransitConditType uint16_t rather than uint16_t. 32 bits are not necessary.
- Renamed m_controllerOffset to m_originOffset in character controller implementations.
- Improved API for character controller.
- Events in the target node of a zero-duration, non-sync events transition that occur at the exact target start point of
  the transition are now sampled during the first frame the target node is active. AtEvent transition conditions will
  also be considered satisfied under the same circumstances.
- Added getBoneNameFromIndex() for rigs.
- Added NMP memory allocation and allocator macros to wrap the NMP_MEMORY_TRACKING_ARGS which previously were required
  explicitly in allocation calls for the debug memory logging.
- Changed win32 and x64 VS2010 project files to explicitly set the name of the intermediate.manifest file (Manifest)
  property to not include the app name. It is redundant as the app name is already part of the $(IntDir) path. Helps
  reduce msbuild errors due to long path names.
- Added node tags support. Each node has a list of user authored tags. Check if a node has a tag by using
  MR::NetworkDef::getNodeTagTable::nodeHasTag(NodeID nodeID, uint32_t tagIndex). A tag index can be obtained using
  MR::NetworkDef::::getNodeTagTable::findTagIndex(const char* tag).
- Added ExpandLimits node which, whilst active, expands the physical joint limits (if the physics rig is active) to
  encompass the node's input transforms.
- [BUG FIX] The HipsIK node now works correctly in Z-up worlds.
- [BUG FIX] The HipsIK node now works correctly with split rigs, when the Hips is not the direct parent of the left and
  right hip joints.
- Only check for PHYSX3_PATH environment variable in morphemePhysicsDriverPhysX3 prebuild step rather than everywhere
  that PhysX is accessed. Makes it easier to change or remove this behaviour. Also done for PhysX2 environment
  variables.
- Removed the 'AlwaysBlendEvents' flag on blend nodes since it was not being used.
- The nodeDefs now store the maximum number of expected active child connections so that the network only needs to
  allocate the required amount.
- Sanitised the number of required queuing functions for the blend nodes. The blend node update connections functions
  determine any queuing optimisations.
- Added source weights and optimisation flags to blend2x2 node.
- Transposed the (x,y) coordinate mapping between the child sources for the NxM blend node to make it consistent with
  the runtime tasks and 2x2 blend node.
- Fixed the over-allocation of memory for the child weights arrays in the NxM node.
- Added X & Y range distribution and wrapping support on the BlendNxM node to make it consistent with the BlendN nodes.
- Source blend weights can now be either increasing or decreasing on all blend nodes.
- Added a AttribDataBlendWeights attrib to unify the X & Y blend weights for the 2D blend nodes and provide a consistent
  way of passing multiple blend weight about.
- Added a AttribDataFeatherBlend2ChannelAlphas attrib to hold the bone weights and the trajectory bone index. This means
  that the rig does not need to be DMA'd to SPU just to determine the trajectory index.
- Added NetworkControlSerialisation which tracks control parameter changes and broadcast messages. These changes can be
  serialised and sent to another target to synchronise networks. See the NetworkControlSerialisation tutorial.
- The closest anim node now updates the network's post update access attributes for transforms and trajectories when
  it's instantiated lowering memory usage.
- Removed padding from MR::AttribData which has lowered the memory requirements of all attrib data, making all networks
  and network restore points smaller.
- MR::NetworkRestorePoint has been re-written so that it's in a single block of memory allowing it to be relocated once
  dislocated. See UPGRADE.TXT.
- Added new callback API to MR::Network. These allow applications to get notifications on various events which happen to
  the network. The current API on MR::Network to set these callbacks is: setStateMachineStateChangeCB,
  setNodeActivationCB, setNodeDeactivationCB, setEventTriggeredCB.
- XMD library now uses a unity build for a lower build time.

3.6.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [HOTFIX-4] Network uses the trajectory channel even when flagged as unused (i.e. when channel is filtered out for
  partial animation or similar).
- [HOTFIX-6] Fraction through source conditions can fail to trigger with some network structures.
- [HOTFIX-7] BlendAll node can sometimes free memory that was still in use, leading to memory corruption.

3.6.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue where the Asset Compiler could crash when MR_RESET_SM_MESSAGE_STATUSES_POST_UPDATE was
  enabled, as it tried to update state machines that hadn't yet been constructed.
- [BUG FIX] The dependent attribute address passed to addConditionAttrib used by some transit conditions no longer uses
  the wrong owning node ID.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed problems where using NMP_MEMORY_LOGGING in the asset compiler would report memory being freed that
  hadn't be allocated.
- [BUG FIX] BlendNxM node now uses duration event track sets from the correct anim set.
- [BUG FIX] TaskQueue::startQueuing now uses the correct alignment for the task queue.
- [BUG FIX] Resolved an issue where jointed (i.e. non-articulation) PhysX3 rigs containing boxes or spheres could crash
  the runtime on being initialised.
- [BUG FIX] The ray cast operator node is now capable of supporting Z-up scenes.
- Upgraded to support the latest platform SDKs.
- Added NetworkDefBuilder::addRigToRigInfoVector so that multiple rigs per animation sets can be added.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a few bugs in runtime tutorials that were causing memory leaks.
- [BUG FIX] Resolved an issue where the "initial value" attribute of a SmoothFloat and SmoothVector3 operator were
  ignored. A bool attribute has also been added to allow network authors to choose between using an initial value, or
  initialising the node from the input control parameter.

3.6.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- No changes.

3.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- LiveLinkDataManager files have been moved into tutorial Common Files.
- [BUG FIX] Tutorials now use correct directory if default network is changed.
- Added VS2010 build support for win32 and x64.
- Various build output directories and filenames have changed slightly. See UPGRADE.TXT.
- Added base MR::PhysicsJointDef type from which all physics joints inherit.
- Added new ragdoll physics joint type MR::PhysicsRagdollDef.
- All soft joint related members of MR::PhysicsSixDOFDef have been moved to a new sub-class
  MR::PhysicsSixDOFDef::SoftLimit.
- Added 'm_' prefix to all MR::PhysicsSixDOFDef member variables.
- The six DOF joint class MR::PhysicsRigDef::Joint::SixDOF is no longer a subclass of MR::PhysicsRigDef and has been
  renamed to MR::PhysicsSixDOFDef.
- All references to joint frame1 and frame2 have been renamed to parentFrame and childFrame respectively.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a packaging bug whereby the AssetExporter and NodeWizard tool solution files were not being included
  in the zip. Now they are.
- [BUG FIX] The freeze node no longer preserves the trajectory delta when activated while generating the semantic
  ATTRIB_SEMANTIC_TRAJECTORY_DELTA_TRANSFORM_BUFFER.
- [BUG FIX] The feather blend node wasn't respecting the pass through mode when time stretching was disabled for some
  semantics.
- [BUG FIX] Transitions now generate an ATTRIB_SEMANTIC_TIME_POS which prevents a crash when an ancestor requires it.
- [BUG FIX] Transitions correctly use the delta trajectory source value when generating the semantic
  ATTRIB_SEMANTIC_TRAJECTORY_DELTA_TRANSFORM_BUFFER.
- [BUG FIX] A time position with the value 0 is produced from freeze nodes when requested.
- Asset compiler variations have been reduced to one for each target platform that takes a list of plugins. See
  UPGRADE.TXT for more information.
- Physics rig assets are now engine specific. Make sure you use the correct plugins for the physics engine used at
  runtime.
- Added a new IK node HipsIK, for moving the character root without changing foot placement.
- Improved retarget solver memory usage.
- Added mechanism to serialize PhysX calls that modifies the physics rig's properties.
- Fixed some compile issues that could prevent the runtime from compiling if MR_ATTRIB_DEBUG_BUFFERING was not defined.
- Network::getControlParameter fixed and now only requires the NodeID of the control parameter being queried. Also added
  a templated version that includes type validation.

3.5.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed animation loading functions in runtime tutorials for x64 solution.
- Significantly improved network compilation time in the asset compiler in large networks with many multiply connected
  passdown pins in the same hierarchy.
- LiveLinkAnimationBrowser tutorial now follows the same initialisation steps as the runtime target.
- Improved RuntimeBasics1 & 2 tutorials so that their bundle handling functions are consistent with later tutorials.
- Improved the pre-build steps for copying PhysX dlls, making them less verbose.
- [BUG FIX] The runtime tutorial's NM_DEBUG_PRINT macro now contains the correct arguments.
- [BUG FIX] The runtime target interface is now notified of all closed connections when the comms server is terminated.
- [BUG FIX] The AttribDataScaleCharacterState in the scale character node now supports the maximum number of bones out
  of all animation sets so that sensible default scale values are used when the active animation set changes even if a
  scale message isn't sent.
- Changed relevant projects to link to officially named FBX libs. See UPGRADE.TXT.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a crash that occurred when compiling mrAnimSectionQSA.cpp in release in visual studio 2010.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed un-initialised memory when move controllers are not calibrated.
- [BUG FIX] Physics rig part physics IDs were not unassigned when the rig was destroyed in PhysX2 targets.
- Added ATTRIB_SEMANTIC_TRAJECTORY_DELTA_TRANSFORM_BUFFER which is a transform buffer that contains the trajectory delta
  in the first array element. This allows for unified tasks when both trajectory deltas and transforms are used which
  reduces the total number of tasks required for a network. See UPGRADE.TXT for more information.
- [BUG FIX] Constraints created on physics bodies in a PhysX2 runtime target were positioned incorrectly if the
  orientation of the body wasn't identity.
- [BUG FIX] Physics bodies belonging to a connection were not cleared up the runtime target if that connection was lost.

3.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Upgraded FBXSDK version to 2012.1.
- Added runtime target flag -physicsRigType to choose between PhysX3 jointed or articulation rigs. Valid options are
  TYPE_JOINTED or TYPE_ARTICULATED with TYPE_ARTICULATED as the default.
- [BUG FIX] State machines used as inputs to multiply referenced passdown pins are now correctly reset to their default
  state when they become active after a period of inactivity.
- (NMMathPlatform.h) NMP_PLATFORM_SIMD is now defined for all platforms supporting SIMD vector processing. Code using
  the NMP::vpu namespace will compile on all supported platforms. See NMvpu.h for implementation.
- The networks AttribDataCharacterController now manages m_worldRootTransform, m_prevWorldRootTransform,
  m_achievedRequestedMovement and m_groundContactTime, making them accessible to SPU code.
- NMFreelistMemoryAllocator now provides, along with the standard list of freelists, a freelist array of standard sizes,
  such as 128, 256, 512 and 1024. All allocations fitting within these sizes are 'bucketed' together which results in a
  less fragmented range of allocations, cutting down on the number of freelists to search, and significantly reducing
  the overall memory allocation.
- Removed lifespan argument from TaskAddInputParam, TaskAddNetInputParam, TaskAddOptionalNetInputParam,
  TaskAddInputParamWithOptionallyInvalidOwningNode, TaskAddOptionalNetInputParamRecurseFilterNodes,
  TaskAddOptionalNetInputParamRecurseToParent, TaskAddInputParamOptionallyInvalidOwningNode, TaskAddParamAndDependency
  and RootTaskAddParamAndDependency in Network. Input parameters don't determine the lifespan of attrib data so the
  parameter was removed to simplify the interface.
- Removed the DWA animation format. Networks using DWA will be upgraded to NSA.
- QSA now compresses the animation channels in local space whenever the animations are compiled with full quality. This
  provides a decompression speed improvement.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed decompression issue with QSA and partial animations.
- Added MR::Network::setTempMemoryAllocator, allowing the temporary memory allocator to be changed between frames. This
  eases use of MR::Network across multiple threads.
- DispatcherBasic::getCachedPtr uses a linked list of cached data blocks meaning it now executes in constant time rather
  than linear.
- State machine transforms are no longer cached for 3 frames if a state machine will never blend which provides some
  memory savings.
- The uneven terrain nodes now optionally consider the vertical trajectory motion of the input source when computing
  foot lifting and surface alignment.
- Renamed all HasQueuingFunctionForSemantic functions to FindGeneratingNodeForSemantic, because that's what they are
  actually doing.
- Renamed MR::Manager::finalizeSematicRegistration to MR::Manager::allocateRegistry to give better indication of what
  this function is doing and in order to not restrict its operation to semantics.
- Removed the static array nodeAttributeSemanticNames as an array of AttribSemantic names is now stored in the manager.
- Renamed define NM_DISABLE_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING to MR_DISABLE_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING.
- Renamed define UNUSED_IF_NO_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING to MR_OUTPUT_DEBUG_ARG.
- Renamed define NULL_IF_NO_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING to MR_NULL_NO_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING.
- Renamed define NM_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING to MR_OUTPUT_DEBUGGING.
- Added 'Always Blend Events' and 'Always Blend Transforms', in Blend nodes, which work in the same way as the existent
  'Always Blend' flag, now renamed to 'Always Blend Transforms'.
- Added Output replace task parameters which re-use existing attrib data.
- Added InputOutput task parameters which are used to reduce the number of task parameters.
- Ordered libs alphabetically in build files.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue adding parent state machines and blend trees after the network had been previewed.
- The TwoBoneIK, HeadLook and GunAimIK nodes have the option to specify their IK targets in character space, as before,
  or in world space.
- LockFoot has a new option to track the character position using the character controller, making it robust to
  downstream or external edits to the trajectory.
- [BUG FIX] In the LockFoot node when toe ground penetration is being corrected, the behaviour was incorrect when the
  toe was buried deep under the ground plane.
- [BUG FIX] In the LockFoot node when foot orientation is also being fixed up for valid interaction with the ground
  plane, the smoothing of foot orientation during the catch-up period after a footplant was not being applied.
- [BUG FIX] Correct arm fixup on GunAimIK when blend weight is not 0 or 1.
- HeadLook and GunAimIK nodes have an option to keep the aiming source upright while aiming.
- HeadLook and GunAimIK nodes have an option to apply joint limits.
- Kinematic joint limit attrib data added to the network definition, so any joint limits you define on your kinematic
  rig will be available to custom nodes.
- Improvements and optimisations to the implementations of the IK nodes, including centralisation of core IK
  functionality to the NMIK library (TwoBoneIK and new PointIK solver).
- Improvements and performance optimisations for NSA and QSA animation formats.
- Compression to rig channel mappings have been removed from the rigToAnim maps. NSA and QSA animation formats now store
  compression to animation channel maps inside each compiled animation.
- Fixed an issue with NSA animations not working with different LOD rigs whenever an animation has been compiled with
  more than one sub-section.
- Improvements to the animation compilation pipeline for better detection of unchanging animation channels.
- Optimisation of data quantisation for NSA and QSA animation compressors for large rig support.
- [BUG FIX] Active animation would drive to incorrect rotations if a physics rig did not directly map to an animation
  rig.
- Build configurations now make a distinction between 'tool' configurations and 'game' configurations. See UPGRADE.TXT
  for more details.
- 'Target PC' configurations added to asset compiler and dependent libraries. See UPGRADE.TXT for more details.
- The PhysX2 driver project now attempts to copy the required PhysX dlls into the bin folder.
- Added ExtractJointInfo node, called before OutputJointPosCP Node, that allows you to extract the position and angle of
  a certain joint.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a crash when there are 2 transitions coming off the ActiveState node and you quickly flick between the
  two.
- [BUG FIX] The random float operator now generates different numbers for different character instances.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue when selecting a destination was not working properly with self transitions with zero
  duration.
- Added a predictive uneven terrain node.
- Improvements to NodeDef, NetworkDef and their builders to allow partially built networks to be instanced and run
  during asset compilation. This enables sub-network evaluation to be performed by nodes during asset compilation to
  pre-compute data.
- The closest anim node now has the option to pre-compute the source transforms offline for faster matching (See
  UPGRADE.TXT for further details).
- Renamed MR::Manager::initAnimFileHandlingFunctions() to MR::Manager::setAnimFileHandlingFunctions().
- Moved the request anim and release anim arguments from MR::Manager::initMorphemeLib() to
  MR::Manager::setAnimFileHandlingFunctions().
- Added runtime messages which allow user defined data to be passed to a node. Transition request conditions are met
  using a message request now. Deprecated the request interface which has been superseded by the messages. (see
  Upgrade.txt for further details).
- Renamed BitArray::isFull() to BitArray::calculateAreAllSet().
- AttribDataStateMachine::getMessageIDsFromActiveState( now requires an extra NetworkDef* parameter.
- Added AttribDataStateMachine::getMessageIDsFromState( that allows you to get MessageIDs on any state.
- Added AttribDataStateMachineDef::getMessageIDsOnBreakoutsFromStateID() &
  AttribDataStateMachineDef::getGlobalMessageIDs() to complement the already existing
  AttribDataStateMachineDef::getMessageIDsFromStateID().
- When using NM_PROFILING it is now possible to output results direct to a log file. See
  PROFILING_LOG_INIT("MorphProfiling.log") in runtimeTarget.cpp.
- The function ::close(socket_t) which was used to close a socket has been renamed to ::closesocket(), to prevent name
  clashes.
- [BUG FIX] Resolved an issue in the sequence node that resulted in crashes when it was used as inputs to pass down
  pins.

3.0.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Avoid an assertion when printing the logged allocations from the FastHeapMemoryAllocator.
- Now using a custom allocator to help improve performance of working with FBX files.
- Added a function to return the size of a block of memory allocated by the FreeListMemoryAllocator.
- [BUG FIX] Resolved an issue that caused transform buffer flags to be set inconsistently, leading to asserts.
- [BUG FIX] A transition with a duration of 0 into a state that contains a multiple pass down pin will no longer
  sometimes cause an assert to trigger.
- [BUG FIX] 32bit and 64bit asset compilers no longer share each others cached files.
- [BUG FIX] PlaySpeedModifier now scales the absolute non-fractional time updates passed from parent.
- [BUG FIX] EventTrackCurveDef::getValueAtTime() correctly interpolates at the end of the interpolation range.
- [BUG FIX] SIMD Blend operations correctly ignore invalid data.
- [BUG FIX] Issue where BlendN would sometimes select the incorrect animation when always blend was disabled has been
  resolved.
- [BUG FIX] Avoided getting the timer frequency more than once in NMP::Timer().
- [BUG FIX] State machines now correctly clears requests on ActiveState transitions when
  MR_RESET_SM_REQUESTS_POST_UPDATE is defined.
- [BUG FIX] State machines now queue pass through tasks unless there's a possible dead blend. This improves performance.
- [BUG FIX] Changed NM_DEBUG to NMP_ENABLE_ASSERTS in the 2 Float operator so the operator can output an error in
  release builds with asserts enabled if the divisor is 0.
- [BUG FIX] BasicUnevenTerrain node will no longer crash if there is no input IK state attribute to use.
- [BUG FIX] Per-node timings in Runtime Debugging are now consistent with section timings.
- [BUG FIX] Network inspection workflow now displays control parameters correctly in Connect.

3.0.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Added MR_USED_FOR_NETWORK_LOGGING to improve builds under MR_NETWORK_LOGGING.
- [BUG FIX] Requests used on normal transitions now also work for breakout and active state transitions.
- Improved compatibility of COMMS library with alternative STL implementations.
- [BUG FIX] Resolved an issue with compiling NSA animations when there are more animated position channels than quat
  channels.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an uninitialized variable that could cause a crash while processing queued tasks.

3.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue with blend nodes connected to the closest anim node crashing runtime. Also fixed closest anim
  setup data not being located properly.
- [BUG FIX] Resolved an issue where NSA animations with 6 subsections could cause joints to not appear.
- [BUG FIX] Asset Compiler: Non-deterministic junk data in unused areas of binary network files eliminated by passing
  the pattern initialising set of memory configuration functions to all asset compiler plugin DLLs.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a size calculation error in the 64 bit asset compiler that could lead to memory corruption.
- [BUG FIX] Avoid division by zero when Input 1 of Operator2Float node is 0.
- [BUG FIX] Padding of assets in the simple bundle fixed to constantly write zeros. (Was writing random values).

3.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed orphaned network files from the resource directory in morpheme:runtime packages.
- [BUG FIX] When no commands are available on the receiving socket, allow the target to step if running asynchronously.
- [BUG FIX] When a connection stops the session stops, it also needs to reset the pause status.
- Changed the runtime tutorial's bundle loading and unloading to be more in line with the runtime target.
- Replaced the persistent memory allocator, set up in networkInstanceRecordManager.cpp, with one based on a FastFreeList
  for performance gains on all platforms.
- Added an initial update to the runtime tutorials during createCharacter to ensure nodes are correctly initialised
  before the update loop.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed lower twist limits issues when using ApplyPhysicsJoinLimits nodes.
- Improvement to the Collapse functionality. Added the possibility to collapse only part of a network.
- As it is now mandatory to have a character controller definition for every exported animation set, the asset compiler
  will fail if it cannot find a CCD for each anim set.
- Likewise, there are now no default fallback values for the character controller def at runtime. The runtime requires a
  CharacterControllerDef for the active animation set.
- The NoPhysics runtime target now creates a character controller representation for the CharacterControllerDef it is
  supplied. This is to prevent confusion about the CC being required in Connect, but not appearing in the viewport on
  simulate. Note that this has not added any collision functionality to the NoPhysics runtime target.
- The ControllerParameters class has been removed from the runtime target code as it was simply duplicating
  functionality of MR::CharacterControllerDef.
- The usePhysicalBody function has been removed from the runtime target as it was causing unclear program flow. Physics
  rigs are now created and destroyed in DefaultPhysicsMgr::createPhysicsRig and destroyPhysicsRig.
- DefaultControllerMgr::createController is now called createControllerRecord. DefaultControllerMgr::removeController is
  now called destroyControllerRecord.
- [BUG FIX] Initialising destination position in instant transitions is now robust. Previously if the destination root
  node was a filter node but processed sync events itself, the destination might not have started at the expected
  position.
- [BUG FIX] Initialisation of Duration event tracks in source anim nodes now a lot more robust, properly taking in to
  account PlayBackwards and StartEventIndex.
- Changed build so that static library pdbs are stored alongside the library in the lib directory rather than in the obj
  intermediate directory. Resolves issue of debug info not being found if obj directory not present.
- Changed build so that the solutions have sensible default projects - the runtimeTarget where possible.
- Changed build so that solution configurations of the form 'Debug Target <platform>' are now called 'Target <platform>
  Debug'. This is to workaround a Visual Studio issue where for some reason the default configuration on opening a
  solution would be 'Debug Target <platform>' rather than Debug. This does not affect the name of any libraries or
  executables but does affect the name of the intermediate folders for these configurations.
- Removed 'Debug Target <platform>' configurations from x64 projects. It is currently not possible to target a 32 bit
  platform with a 64 bit asset compiler.
- Overhauled RTTI and exception settings (all platforms/compilers).
- Increased optimisation levels for PC projects to Full Optimisation (/Ox).
- [BUG FIX] Specifying destination start position in active state transitions and self transitions now works in the
  targets real sync event space (rather than adjusted sync event space). Basically makes transition authoring a lot
  clearer.
- [BUG FIX] TransitConditionInSyncEventRange is now only true when crossing an event range if the prev node ID (where we
  got the last frames value from) is the same as the current node. Changing the active node was causing an event jump in
  some cases and this was causing the condition to incorrectly become true.
- The OutputJointPosCP Node has been removed.

3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Implemented the asynchronous stepping mode on runtime side so that the RTT can implement its own stepping model and it
  doesn't need to wait for a step command indefinitely.
- Changed all the network traffic to be big endian so that big endian runtimes don't need to perform any endian
  swapping.
- Added runtime target interface to teleport a character to a specific location via the character controller.
- Improved the main loop of the standard runtime target. It now supports the ability of following the frame rate that
  Connect suggests.
- Streamlined RuntimeTutorials and their folders to be more readable and easier to follow.
- Changed EventsRequestsAndControlParameters name to ControlAndFeedback.
- Tutorials that do not use physics will now initialise Physics in the PhysX version of morpheme. This ensures that the
  networks will run correctly when using the PhysX Asset compiler and Runtime.
- The BasicUnevenTerrain node now supports a choice of foot clamping modes whenever the terrain slope is greater than
  the maximum limit.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed an issue when the hip height controller in the BasicUnevenTerrain node is at its maximum and the
  character then becomes ungrounded snapping the feet back to their animation poses.
- Default IkFkBlendWeight for the BasicUnevenTerrain node is no longer stored in the node def when a control parameter
  is not connected to the node.
- The morpheme runtime now supports x64 platforms. There are solutions available for the asset compiler and runtime
  target for Windows x64. Note that you cannot currently use a native x64 asset compiler to build assets for 32-bit
  platforms. You will need to continue to use the 32-bit AC for these platforms.
- Build system has been improved and is fully consistent. Build artifacts are now generated in top level bin/lib/obj
  folders, not in local library folders, as far as build environments will allow.
- Moved animation resampling into the AnimationCompressor class so that AnimSourceUncompressed can be used as a useful
  intermediate representation of the anim data in the XMD.
- SimpleBundle now stores the runtime version number that contained assets were cooked with. The target platform is also
  stored. Asset loading will raise asserts if the assets' version doesn't match the runtime they are being loaded into,
  or if the platforms are mismatched.
- SimpleBundle has been optimised to reduce un-necessary padding. NMP_GLOBAL_OBJECT_ALIGNMENT has been removed.
- MR_TASK_QUEUE_MAX_TASKS has been removed. There is no longer a maximum number of Tasks that can be queued. This change
  will make support of larger networks more memory-efficient.
- CustomPhysicsInterface has been removed from the runtime, simplifying the physics interface.
- It is now no longer allowed to switch animation sets if they contain two different physics rigs. This used to be
  implicitly allowed, even though it was not properly supported and would cause incorrect behaviour or crashes.
- Added NetworkBuilderPlugin to allow plug-ins to the asset compiler to insert attrib data into the network.
- Moved the Physics def data into new NetworkBuilderPlugin system.
- Added an assert to make sure a task is registered with the network's dispatcher at queuing time. This will make it
  much easier to work out why it's failing to get the task pointer.
- Modified PhysicsRig<engine>::getRoot to take a CharacterControllerDef so we can sensibly scale the raycast into the
  world (and the foot offset) rather than assuming meter units.
- Improved the ability for the asset compiler to report back to the user via connect when something goes wrong. Replaced
  NMP_ASSERT* with NMP_VERIFY* in all AC-only code.
- Cleaned up the use of RuntimeAssetID and AssetType in simpleBundle.

2.3.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed event conditions failing to fire when using start event index offsets.
- [BUG FIX] Made switch node evaluate whether to change input based on whether it has finished rather than whether it
  will finish.
- [BUG FIX] Fix problems with the root offset rotation for Z-up characters in the closest anim node.
- [BUG FIX] The quaternion resulting from the uneven terrain angular velocity and acceleration joint control function is
  now normalised to prevent numerical drift over time.
- Improvements to uneven terrain to prevent leg jitter when walking down steep slopes or when the character controller
  jumps between steps.
- [BUG FIX] All conditions for a possible breakout transition from a destination state are now evaluated, rather than
  just the first.
- [BUG FIX] Included the 'Animation Scale' setting in the id of runtime animations to avoid conflicts.
- [BUG FIX] State Machines now clear their activeStateID on deletion to prevent broadcast condition requests being set
  in inactive states.
- [BUG FIX] mr::Manager no longer accepts registration of null pointers or Object ID of 0.
- [BUG FIX] The default null physics rig now has a non zero asset ID.
- [BUG FIX] Improved dead blend during breakout transitions.
- Added "Always Blend" to BlendN nodes. Turning this value off will passthrough a single animation transform rather than
  blend 2 together when the blend weight is on a source blendweight. See mrNodeBlendNOpt.cpp/h for threshold.
- New LockFoot node features, including ankle joint ground correction, and foot orientation fixup.
- New SmoothTransforms node, for removing noise and sudden motion in an animation.
- All IK nodes (TwoBoneIK, HeadLook, LockFoot, GunAimIK and BasicUnevenTerrain) now add required channels automatically
  if they are missing.

2.3.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Fixed handling of node data where a certain type of data was requested but is not available from the node.
- Optimized LiveLink protocol for improved performance.

2.3.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added support for transitions to an active state by dead blending. 'Dead blend source on breakout' enabled transitions
  cache their source state so dead reckoning can be used to approximate their evolution over a short period of time,
  freeing the source state for another transition. If a physics rig is available, it will also be used to enforce joint
  limits.
- [BUG FIX] Prevented transitions from transitions firing when their target state is active.
- Changed m_assetDef and m_assetData to m_characterDef and m_characterData. Other tutorial layout improvements.
- [BUG FIX] Stop the trajectory freezing for a single update when transitioning from soft/hard keyframing to
  ragdoll/active animation.
- [BUG FIX] Made sure that Closest Anim Node restores the old task queue on dispatcher as well as on the network after
  sub network evaluation.
- [BUG FIX] Made sure that def data that is of a ref counted type is handled correctly.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a potential buffer overrun when using NSA and QSA compression with SIMD enabled.
- [BUG FIX] Removed code which registers a collision callback that was never used.
- Removed the need for any nodeInstanceStaticMemReqs functions. All AttribData on Network now goes through persistent or
  temp mem allocators. This also fixes the functionality of the NetworkRestorePoint class.
- Modified animation compressor to take into account the blend frame translation as well as the rotation when compiling
  animations.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed issue where RigToAnim maps were generating GUIDs that collided.
- [BUG FIX] createDefaultDiscreteEventTrack() now checks the manager for an instance of the default track that could
  have been created by another network.
- [BUG FIX] NM_LOG_ASSERT_MESSAGE will now assert when NMP_ENABLE_ASSERTS is defined rather than NM_DEBUG.
- Runtime tutorialBasic3 and others now create an ExampleCharacterController that will track the position and
  orientation of the character network. The accumulated transforms now use this data to correctly update the transforms.
- Converted all projects to VisualStudio 2008.
- Upgraded morpheme:runtime to be compatible with PhysX 2.8.3.
- Added a basic uneven terrain node.
- Incremented MAX_NUM_QUEUED_TASKS_PER_NODE to 9 since the uneven terrain node queues 9 tasks for evaluation in
  conjunction with lock foot nodes and a transit match events between states. This adds 8 bytes per node to the memory
  footprint.
- [BUG FIX] The asset compiler now takes into account the blend frame orientation when generating the mirror node
  mappings.
- Added Multiple Networks tutorials 1-3. These tutorials look at running multiple instances of morpheme networks
  simultaneously.
- [BUG FIX] Incorrect trajectory used by mirror node, caused large gnomon to be drawn in Connect.
- [BUG FIX] Added sync event track pass-through support to FeatherBlend2 node.
- [BUG FIX] Rewrote calculateSyncEventIndexDelta(), adding correct handling of looping with only 1 event in track to
  avoid negative SyncEventPos fraction.
- [BUG FIX] Changed sampling of duration event to ensure that FractionThroughDurationEvent of 1 is successful, but only
  producing a zero once.
- [BUG FIX] Added limitToSyncEventSpace() to EventTrackSync::convEventInAdjustedSpaceToRealSpace() to prevent out of
  range sync event index.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed assert in SyncEventPos::set() caused by a parent multiple event delta during a single update not being
  limited to the target sync event space.

2.3.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved binary asset invariance by initialising padding memory and pointers in serialised assets.
- Added const return values for AssetProcessor API.
- Asset compiler now uses the GUID of the Rig to generate the GUID of the RigToAnimMap.
- The Asset Compiler now defaults to initialising all allocated memory to 0xcdcdcdcd.
- Networks no longer reset temporary allocators passed in at creation time.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed FractionThroughDurationEvent not triggering in some cases.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed issue with animations having un-even section sizes.
- [BUG FIX] Raised the value of ACCURATE_DIVISION_ERROR_LIMIT in NMVector3.cpp to take into account 360 floating point
  accuracy.
- [BUG FIX] Changed Vector3::slerp to check for parallel cases using just the dotproduct instead of an angle.
- [BUG FIX] Corrected the owning nodeID for task index 3 of nodeTransitBlend2QueueSampledEventsBuffers.
- [BUG FIX] Changed the method transits used to trigger end of transit in reverse cases. No longer sets blendweights to
  -1.0f and instead sets them to 0.0f (solves an assert case in scaleBlendWeight()).
- [BUG FIX] broadcastRequestToStateMachines() now returns false if the request was not picked up by any state.
- Store the 'blend weight' in sampled events to inform at to how much the events contributed to the final result.
- Added Temporary and Persistent memory allocators to the runtime tutorials that call Netowrk::createAndInit() instead
  of using the default ones.
- Modified Switch node to delete all child instances when they become inactive and to re-initialize them when they are
  reactivated.
- QSA sections now check the memory size during bitstream decoding.
- Asset compiler can now handle single frame animations.
- [BUG FIX] Made it so Sequence nodes can be the parent or child of another Sequence node and operate as expected.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a bug that caused the nodes to become idle with the wrong lifespan when using Sequence Nodes.
- Added Customisable BlendWeights to the nodes Blend2, Blend2MatchEvents, Featherblend2 and FeatherBlend2MatchEvents.
  This feature acts the same as it does for BlendN nodes.
- Modified the runtime physics tutorials to better distinguish between initialising PhysX and the morphemePhysicsScene.
- [BUG FIX] fixed a bug in the tutorials that where registerNodeInitDatas() wasn't being called on initialisation.
- Modified the runtime tutorials to be clearer and more streamlined.
- NXPhysics calls have been moved out tutorial functions and into main and the update functions have been simplified.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a bug where FeatherBlend2MatchedEvents nodes where allocating more memory than they where actually
  using.
- [BUG FIX] The LockFoot node could have invalid output on console if the 'Damping' was 0.
- [BUG FIX] PassThrough Node was allocating memory for filter weights Unnecessarily. This has been removed.
- [BUG FIX] Changed the assertion checks for duplicate registrations of tasks to only happen in Debug. This removes the
  false positives in release, with asserts on, due to compiler optimisations.
- Added faster buffer access for Pos/Quat and Vel/AngVel type buffers.
- Renamed NMP::Buffer::SetChannelUsed() to SetChannelUsedFlag() and added SetChannelUsed()/SetChannelUnused() to be used
  in places there the used flag is constant.
- [BUG FIX] The TwoBoneIK, LockFoot and GunAimIK nodes did not work correctly if the hinge axis was not perpendicular to
  the bones.

2.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Add missing endian swaps to AttribDataSourceDurationEventTrackSet locate() and dislocate().
- Fix asymmetric clamp to limits.
- Added API to MR::Manager to report whether an object has already been registered for a given AssetID.
- Modified the AttribDataSourceAnim to store the anim type in serialised assets.
- Renamed the 'loadAnim' and 'unloadAnim' callbacks in the MR::Manager to 'requestAnim' and 'releaseAnim'.
- QSA animation compressor no longer just reports that it is unable to compress an animation with a very low compression
  rate, but will compile the animation using the lowest valid compression rate.
- [BUG FIX] Fix QSA compressor hitting divide by zero condition with rigs with a single bone.
- Added helper functions nodeTransitGetSourceState() and nodeTransitGetDestinationState() to retrieve the source and
  destination of a transit node.
- Bool control parameters are now stored in bool attribute data.
- Added int control parameters.
- Prefixed all tinyxml headers and include guards with 'NM', to remove clashes with other versions of tinyxml.
- [BUG FIX] Closest anim node now supports finding the offset rotation at the character root that aligns the input
  source with the network output. This offset rotation is distributed over time between the character root and the
  trajectory channel so that the character appears in the correct place whilst blending the controlled root orientation
  to the correct pose.
- [BUG FIX] Runtime IDs for duration events are no longer always set to zero.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed MBA animation format locate() and relocate() memory alignment issue.
- [BUG FIX] QSA compressor handles delta transforms for additive animation more sensibly. Error analysis could get into
  problems where the average bone length was zero, resulting in poor quantisation.
- Replaced the morpheme:runtime examples with new Runtime Tutorials that have been updated to work with the latest
  version of morpheme and have been redesigned to be more re-usable and clearer tutorial code. These can be found in the
  "/samples/tutorials" directory in the runtime source.

2.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Significant performance and memory improvements throughout the code. See UPGRADE.TXT for more details.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed mem alignment issues in MBA.
- Exposed the node names string table with NetworkDef::getNodeIDNamesTable().
- [BUG FIX] Fixed issues with very short discrete events.
- Asserts can be enabled in release by defining NMP_ENABLE_ASSERTS.
- [BUG FIX] DataBlockExportXML::Element::getBytes could potentially overrun the buffer.
- Removed Switch with Events source as it contained redundant code that the Switch node could already handle. Now the
  difference lies only in the manifest.
- Network::startUpdate has had a new parameter added to allow you to prevent transforms being calculated. This is set to
  true by default so no action should be required.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed issues with very short discrete events.
- Replaced the m_tasks vector in the TaskQueue with a simple array.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed erroneous NMP::Quat::isNormal() return values.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed reconnection issue when using multiple networks.

2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] unfix/refix the memory requirements array during dislocate/locate OF AttribDataSourceDiscreteEventTrackSet,
  AttribDataSourceDurationEventTrackSet and AttribDataSourceCurveEventTrackSet.
- Use fast heap and the roll back point system to allocate temporary working memory in HeadLook task, rather than using
  the heap.
- Renamed m_eventTrackNames to m_eventTrackIDNamesTable for consistency with all other tables in NetworkDef.
- [BUG FIX] NodeOperatorSmoothFloat was using cached data from frames older than the last frame in some cases. Now
  initialises to input value if cached data is older than last frame.
- [BUG FIX] Closest anim node problem: Update connectivity wasnt called on the children of the closest anim node on the
  first update.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed the dislocate of AttribDataNoiseGenDef (Missing endian swaps).
- Better parameter validation inside Dispatcher::TaskParameters::createOutputAttrib when using the replace option (To
  make sure param flags actually match the param creation options).
- [BUG FIX] queuing a param to be replace but not creating the param with replace in the task itself
  (TaskBlend2SyncEventTracks & TaskTransitSyncEventsBlendSyncEventTracks).
- Improved Network::debugValidateAttribContents to display log error messages and to catch node attrib bins growing too
  large.
- Added initAnimFileHandlingFunctions function to Manager to allow setting of these functions independent of the manager
  initialisation.
- Moved initialisation of morpheme lib/Manager and hence NMP::Memory out of live link and into the main RTT function, to
  avoid initialising it twice.
- Added init and deinit functions to DefaultSceneObjectMgr to prevent heap allocation inside the constructor. Added some
  error checking when allocating/deallocating environment attributes vector.
- Added an initialised flag to the memory system to introduce more robust error checking.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed attempts to deallocate memory that was not allocated in some cases in
  NetworkDefBuilder::createRequestIDNameMappingTable.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed mem leak: Free allocated memory that is used to store the compiled compressed animations in
  macProcessAnimFunc.
- [BUG FIX] Memory logging print out or remaining allocation was overstepping the static buffer length and trashing
  memory.
- When the physics node is acting as a rag doll it has no children and hence needs to be able to provide a full
  complement of tasks and queuing functions, much like an anim source node. This is now the case.
- [BUG FIX] Failing to update the connectivity of a transit when a child of the transit changed.
- Make conditions that inspect control param or operator node data, update the connected nodes immediate op before
  trying to find its data. This is safe because conditions are evaluated in the updateConnections phase of the network
  update.
- [BUG FIX] Stopped nodeTransitSyncEventsUpdateConnections() from crashing in some cases when source had not retained
  its ATTRIB_SEMANTIC_SYNC_EVENT_TRACK and the transit was attempting to init a dead blend.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed the conversion from an event duration to a time duration in nodeTransitSyncEventsUpdateConnections().
- Made all sync event nodes retain their ATTRIB_SEMANTIC_SYNC_EVENT_TRACK attrib data to improve our overall dead blend
  behaviour. (Able to make a more accurate calculation of how long the dead blend should last).
- Added utility function BlendOpsBase::accumulateTransforms to find the accumulating transform of a single bone.
- Fixed bug in PhysicsRig::toTransformBuffer: Converting physics rig world transforms to anim rig local transforms was
  assuming that if a physics joint did not have a parent then it was connected directly to the anim world root.
- Renamed Rig to AnimRigDef.
- Renamed RigBuilder to AnimRigDefBuilder.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed several bits of code that were assuming Y up in runtime code. Mostly in the character controller and
  physics.
- [BUG FIX] Initialise gravity from scene environment data rather than just assuming that it acts in y axis.
- Removed wasteful m_name from NodeDef. This data is repeated in the NetworkDef.

  NA_NODE.
- [BUG FIX] Set deleted nodes as inactive.
- [BUG FIX] Stopped directly accessing node delete functions (always go through network).

- TaskAddParam now copes with empty parameters via use of INVALID_NODE_ID.
- Added new TaskParamFlag TPARAM_FLAG_OPTIONAL to improve task param validation.
- Remove pointless ability for blend2 nodes to operate without connected cp nodes. Removes large amounts of code and

- Removed Blend2Opt as a stand alone node; instead added "AlwaysBlend" flag to Blend2 and Blend2MatchEvents that allows
  these nodes to operate in a Blend2Opt style.
- [BUG FIX] Failing to get root node attributes when the root was a filter. (Time line event oddities in Connect).
- [BUG FIX] transitSyncEvents. When transit starts on very first frame it is unable to initialise its start event pos
  from the source.
- Made duration event blending cope much better with looping tracks.

2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Converting XMD animations into the uncompressed runtime ready format: Modified the functions that check for
  unvarying channels. The previous check for quat channels with small rotations was unreliable.
- [BUG FIX] Asset compiler incorrectly identifying override channels when compiling anims. (Regression from 1.3 to 2.x).
- Added a new Discrete Wavelet Animation compression format (DWA).
- New Reversible Transitions Feature. You can now reverse the direction of a transitions during its execution using a
  boolean control parameter.
- New SwitchWithEvents node that works as the Switch node but passes through events.
- [BUG FIX] fix to Switch node when input nodes are not AnimMatchEvent nodes and EvalAtEndOfAnim is true.
- Changed the MR::Network::update and MR::Dispatcher::execute API to return an ExecuteResult enum with the current
  execution status.
- Removed getGravity and setGravity from the MR::PhysicsScene interface class (as it's not used by morpheme itself).
- Removed reference to the PhysicsScene from the DefaultSceneObjectMgr. The PhysicsMgr is responsible for setting any
  data on the physics scene now.
- Removed a large amount of unused code from the Null Physics integration.
- Moved all animation source builder code into the asset compiler and moved all animation decompression code into a
  subdirectory AnimSource.
- Removed the use of STL and therefore new/delete from PhysicsRigPhysX.
- Removed PhysicsRigDef::createPhysicsRig() and destroyPhysicsRig() and replaced them with
  PhysicsRig::getMemoryRequirements(), init() and term() to prevent masses of small allocations under the new scheme.
- Removed PhysicsRigPhysX::setPhysicsScene as it's no longer applicable to swap scenes on an existing PhysicRigPhysX.
- Changed the mechanism for creating dispatchers so that instead of calling constructors, there is a createAndInit
  function for them.
- [BUG FIX] Uses of new() and delete() in the runtime API that would cause allocations to be made outside NMP::Memory
  have been removed.
- Changed the mechanism for creating dispatchers so that instead of calling constructors (and therefore using new),
  there are createAndInit/release functions for them.
- Renamed MR::AttribDataPhysicsRigAndRigDef to MR::AttribDataPhysicsRig and removed the pointer to the rig def (as you
  can get it from the rig anyway so it was redundant). The containing file has also been renamed from
  mrPhysicsRigAndRigDef.h/cpp to mrPhysicsAttribData.h/cpp.
- NMP::FreeListManager has been removed from NMPlatform.
- NMP::FreeLists will now automatically grow to accommodate new allocations when they are full.
- NMP::FreelistMemoryAllocator has been added to NMPlatform.
- MR::Networks now use the FreelistAllocator instead of the HeapAllocator to manage persistent memory. This brings a
  performance increase and will prevent Networks using malloc and free while running (once the freelists have grown to
  their required capacity).

2.0.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] The debug configuration of the NoPhysics runtime target was incorrectly linking the release mode SPU
  executable against the debug NMPlatform library, causing crashes. This has been fixed.
- AnimationSourceHandle::openAnimation() now uses the registered animation format functions from the runtime manager to
  locate() the animation data in memory. This replaces the static list of switch-case statements.
- The NMP_MEMORY_LOGGING switch is now supported, allowing you to gather statistical information about memory
  allocations the runtime SDK makes.
- All known memory leaks in the runtime SDK have been fixed.

2.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Finished removing copyright symbol and replacing it with (c) - .inl files had previously been missed.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed crash on animation set swap.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a timing issue in the RuntimeExample2.
- Updated the testNetwork for the RuntimeExample2.
- Implemented getRequestIDFromRequestName and getRequestNameFromRequestID functions.
- [BUG FIX] NodeBlend2Opt was crashing if the control parameter input was routed from an operator node, due to a bug in
  getControlParameter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- RuntimeExample2 has been added, demonstrating Physics integration support.
- Changed copyright symbol to (c) to avoid compilation errors on some systems.

2.0.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [BUG FIX] Ensure Quat::toRotationVector() returns the tan quarter angle rotation vector corresponding to the quat in
  the positive hemisphere.

2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- For morpheme 2.0, the morpheme:runtime library has been re-written. Therefore an explicit list of changes would be
  inappropriate for this release. Please refer to https://docs.naturalmotion.com/morpheme2/index.php/RuntimeChanges for
  a high-level overview of the major API-level changes for this release. Refer to the documentation wiki topics for more
  in-depth explanation of the workings of morpheme:runtime 2.0.
- The NMPlatform library has undergone an incremental development schedule from 1.3.x to 2.0, instead of a rewrite, so
  the following section is a list of NMPlatform related changes.
- Added the NMP::MemoryAllocator class, providing a swappable intermediate for memory allocation. This allows app code
  to rapidly change the memory allocation system used (e.g. from FastHeap to Freelist style allocation) without changing
  client code. Several default allocators also provided.
- Added extra asserts and more helpful messages when asserts fail.
- Removed many references to NM-specific types (such as nu32, ni32, etc), replacing them with C99 types.
- Added relocate() functions to many objects, allowing them to be moved around in memory.
- Copyrights updated to 2009.
- Improved Quat::forRotation()'s handling of anti-parallel input vectors.
- Made Quat::forRotation() robust to zero-length input vectors.
- Overhaul Quat::forRotation to try to squeeze more accuracy out of it for small angles.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a bug with expending freelists.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a bug in FreeList::reduceRequestedCapacity().

1.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Split the runtime target interface into component parts.
- Added API to get the name of network instances from running runtime targets.
- The Network operations queuing order has been changed within mrNetwork.cpp within the functions: Network::startUpdate
  and Network::createAndInit. ATTRIB_OP_TYPE_SampleEvents must now be queued before ATTRIB_OP_TYPE_UpdateTransforms
  rather than after. Note also that ATTRIB_OP_TYPE_SampleEvents also pushes a flag from the root indicating if we want
  to sample from duration event buffers.
- File > SaveAs changes the GUIDs to make sure that they are unique.
- Completely reworked the runtime zip directory structure to be much cleaner and more intuitive. It is intended that
  this structure is final and will not be changed again.
- Reworked the deployment of the runtime zips. There is now a 'base' zip, on top of which can be unzipped multiple
  platform zips, which just contain the extra files necessary for that platform.
- Improved deployment practices. All configurations of all solutions are now built automatically as part of the QA
  process which has removed errors in rarely used configurations.
- morpheme:runtime now has its own versioning scheme and changes.txt. The current version can be found in mrVersion.h.
- [BUG FIX] AnimSourceWithEvents has inlined functions defined in the header.
- NMP::Memory is now a namespace rather than a class.
- Changed the default Network Execution to Sample the Events before Updating the Transforms.
- Added option to spherically interpolate delta trajectory translations in all default blend node types. This prevents
  foot sliding in situations such as blending a strafe right with a walk forwards.
- Added a NOT condition to request condition types.
- Renamed any function names of 'initialise' to 'init' to conform to the same standard used throughout runtime code.
- Renamed ATTRIB_OP_TYPE_UpdateTrajectoryChannelDeltas to ATTRIB_OP_TYPE_UpdateTrajectoryChannel.
- Renamed ATTRIB_DATA_TYPE_TrajectoryChannelDeltas to ATTRIB_DATA_TYPE_PosQuatChannel.
- [BUG FIX] Animation sections now set their flags correctly.
- [BUG FIX] Transition smoothing for all transitions was incorrect, causing a jerk at the start of transitions. This has
  been fixed to give good smooth in and smooth out of transitions.
- Animation IDs stored within the AnimationSet have been changed from strings to an integer m_globalAnimID stored in
  each AnimSetEntry. It is the app's responsibility to convert this to a filename, or resolve it to a resource handle,
  depending on their asset packing scheme. This would be done in the app's registered ProcessAnimFunc.
- Added Task-specific IK nodes: TwoBoneIK, HeadLook, and LockFoot.
- FreelistManager is now in the NMPlatform library instead of the morpheme runtime.
- Added NMSync to NMPlatform. This provides a cross-platform mutex object.
- Added mutex protection to the temporary memory freelist manager in MR::Manager. This restores morpheme's thread safety
  for update API calls.
- "Warnings treated as errors" is now enabled across all code in the morpheme codebase on every platform.
- Performance optimisations to the blend operations. Roughly 2% reduction to network update time (on demo 3).
- NMPlatform and morpheme moved over to using ptrdiff_t and size_t instead of uint32_t for pointer arithmetic.
- Separated TrajectoryControl into TrajectoryControlBase (which morpheme runtime interfaces with) and
  TrajectoryControlCompressed (which is the implementation that AnimSourceCompressed provides).
- Added the new AnimSourceBasic animation format, an uncompressed version of AnimSourceCompressed.
- Updated the Matrix34::toQuat function so it works for matrices which are not exactly orthonormal.
- Moved the responsibility for deciding on the number of entries per block for the freelist manager into the code that
  uses it (rather than hardcoding it to 8).
- The AssetCompiler now re-uses the existing runtime ID in the animation cache if an animation file must be
  re-processed.
- Removed the need to use TempRig.xmd in the AssetCompiler.
- AssetCompiler no longer reloads the animation files after processing. This significantly speeds up animation set
  compilation time, especially when the anims are cached.
- Moved the generation of RigToAnimMaps into the animation processor rather than the AssetProcessor.
- RigToAnimMaps are now cached with the animations that they are generated to work against.
- When a RigToAnimMap is inserted into an AnimationSet, We now binary compare it against all other RigToAnimMaps in the
  set to see if they are duplicates, and combine them if they are.
- The AssetProcessor has been moved to its own library, rather than the source files being directly included in the
  assetCompiler project.
- An AnimationLibrary runtime object has been added. It contains a collection of AnimationSets which are all targeting a
  common network.
- Added NMP::Vector3::isValid function that allows you to check for QNANs and INFs in the vector's components.
- MR::Rigs now contain the bind pose which was exported in the source XMD file.
- If an animation source generates invalid channels for some channels, the bind pose positions and orientations are
  copied into those channels.
- The FeatherBlend, AnimWithEvents and FilterTransforms nodes now have AnimationSet specific attributes .
- Buffered Transform data from nodes now copies the Rig bind pose into any channels that were marked in the source
  NMP::DataBuffer as invalid.
- [BUG FIX] Changed several incorrect spellings of "ouput" to "output".
- Correctly moved all content of the AssetProcessor in to the namespace AP.
- [BUG FIX] Location and Dislocation of NodeDefOperatorNoiseGen now works.
- [BUG FIX] Bug fix: Single frame node outputs a zero delta trajectory update, rather than not outputting any trajectory
  delta at all.
- NodeApplyBindPose: New filter node type that applies the rig bind pose transforms to any un-initialised transforms in
  the input buffer.
- Animation application to multiple rigs now supported through the generation of RigToAnimMaps.
- An animation will only be compiled against 2 Rigs if the Rigs are determined to be compatible. i.e. their hierarchies
  up to the trajectory bone and the character root bone are identical.
- Animation compilation now only includes those animation bones that are also present in the Rigs that the animation is
  being compiled against.
- RigToAnimMap members and functions have been renamed for consistency.
- New documentation: RigToAnimMaps and Sharing Animations between Rigs: Explains how RigToAnimMaps are used and how they
  can be used to have an anim used on more than one rig and the process of generating data for animations to be shared
  between more than one rig.
- New documentation: The morpheme Event Handling System: Explains the updated event handling system.
- Event sequences authored as Duration event sequences in 1.2 are now interpreted as the new DurationEventSequence type
  exhibiting different behaviour. In order to produce the same behaviour as 1.2 re-author these event sequences as Float
  event sequences.
- New runtime event sequence type: Duration event sequence.
- All event sequence Defs inherit from EventsSequenceDefBase which now has: A runtime id (m_runtimeID) that can be used
  to find the sequences name in the AnimationSet andUser data (m_userData), an integer ID that comes from Connect.
- Removed use of bit fields in manifest from transit match events, in class NodeDefTransitMatchEvents NMP::Flags
  m_transitFlags is now bool m_usingDestStartEventIndex.
- Added interface functions to Network to access array of state machines in a Network.
- Simplified and improved the interface for setting and clearing requests.
- In NodeStateMachine renamed getRootNode to getActiveNode and getRootNodeID to getActiveNodeID to avoid confusion with
  the root node of the Network.

1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed the tidy() function from nodes, it was never being called and any necessary functionality should be in term().
- TransformBuffer, TransformBufferMatrix and TransformBufferPosQuat have all been replaced by NMP::DataBuffer, a
  relocatable, streamable container.
- Buffers to store the output of each node are now allocated when they are required, rather than when the node is
  created. Additionally, they are released as soon as they have been used, if they are no longer needed for buffering
  operations.
- All nodes node have a pointer to their parent node (i.e. the one which consumes their output). This is accessible via
  Node::getParentNode.
- Added network restore points, allowing the state of a network to be cached away and restored at a later date, forcing
  the network into a known configuration.
- NMP::Memory::alloc and NMP::Memory::free have been renamed to memAlloc and memFree to prevent clashes with other
  products which may #define alloc or free.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed a logic bug in TransformBuffer::setAllChannelsUsed.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed logic bugs in NMP::BitArray which were causing arrays to be constructed the wrong size.
- Input weighting values now specifiable on BlendN node types.

  asset compiler.
- [BUG FIX] Allow update of trajectory delta without necessity for update of transforms in a network update sequence.
- New JBA animation compression scheme.

  one to be added by the weighting value first.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed direct setting of a state machine into a desired state using setStateByStateID.
- Unified executable names for the Asset Compiler and runtime target executables across all platforms.
- [BUG FIX] StateMachine::requestSetState() now functions correctly.
- Naming convention for identification of nodes made consistent throughout code, including function names;
  nodeNetworkID, networkNodeID, networkIndex, networkNodeIndex, and nodeIndex all renamed to nodeID. e.g.
  Network::getCurrentStateNetworkId renamed to getCurrentStateNodeId.

  renamed to stateID.
- Naming convention for identification of requests made consistent throughout code.
- [BUG FIX] Fixed setting state on a state machine.

  set.
- [BUG FIX] Delta trajectory jumping on looping of curved trajectory paths.

- Added m_destStartEventFraction to NodeTransitAtEvent to allow building of more responsive transitions of this type.
- Renamed AnimationBinding to a more descriptive AnimSetEntry.
- Removed enum BufferType and replaced with TRANSFORM_TYPE_ defines to make adding of new types by clients more
  accessible.

  FALSE condition. Making incorrect assumption about how Connect stores condition data in its export.
- [BUG FIX] AssetCompiler: insertComponentSorted inserting in wrong place sometimes, meant that memory pool requirements
  were incorrectly calculated.
