// ***** Waitable and Acquisition Interface

/*
    AcquireInterface provides a two-stage acquisition interface for a resource. This interface is used
    primarily to acquire multiple objects that can be shared among threads. For this reason,
    AcquireInterface is often used together with Waitable. Whenever a waitable object changes state
    indicating that a shared resource is potentially available, this abstract acquisition interface is used to 
    acquire the resource in a resource-independent manner.
              
    In the first stage of acquisition TryAcquire is called to see if the resource can be obtained. If it succeeds, 
    the resource is considered to be acquired, and TryAcquireCommit is called to confirm the ownership. If the
    resource is, however, not needed (because, for example, acquisition of another object in a multi-object wait
    has failed) TryAcquireCancel can be called.

/*
    Waitable interface is used for thread-shared objects that need to be waited on. A waitable object
    has an associated 'Signalled' state such that an object is signaled when its associated resource is available,
    and non-signaled when it is not available. Some objects, such as a Semaphore, can have multiple internal signaled
    states; in this case the object is considered to be signaled if ANY amount of a resource is available, and
    non-signaled if NO resource is available.

    Waiting on a Waitable object is achieved with help of handlers installed by the waiter threads. Whenever the
    objects state changes from non-signaled to signaled, or from one internal gradation of signaled to another,
    wait handlers are called (handlers should not get called when the object changes its state from signaled to
    non-signaled). When called, wait handlers can be used to wake up a waiter thread, so that it can compete for the
    acquisition of the object's associated resource. The actual acquisition of the resource can happen either through
    object-specific methods for with help of an associated AcquireInterface.
