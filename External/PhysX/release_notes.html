<h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">January 2013</h2>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.2.4</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Note: PS3 platform specific changes can be found in the PS3 readme file.</i></li>
		<li>Fixed a bug which caused actors to return wrong world bounds if the bounds minimum was above 10000 on any axis.</li>
		<li>Reporting allocation names can now be enabled or disabled (see PxFoundation::setReportAllocationNames). When enabled, some platforms allocate memory through 'malloc'.</li>
		<li>eEXCEPTION_ON_STARTUP is removed from PxErrorCode and it is no longer needed.</li>
		<li>Add boilerplate.txt. SpuShaderDump.exe and clang.exe require it.</li>
		<li>PxWindowsDelayLoadHook.h has been moved from Include/foundation/windows to Include/common/windows.</li>
		<li>PxScene::saveToDesc now reports the bounceThresholdVelocity value.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Forces applied to bodies (with PxRigidBody::addForce) that go to sleep in the subsequent update now have their applied forces cleared when the body is set to sleep to avoid them being applied in a later update when the body is once more awake.  This bug broke the rule that forces applied with PxRigidBody::addForce do not persist beyond the next scene update.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Cooking</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PxCookingParams constructor is now marked as deprecated. PxToleranceScale is needed for PxCookingParams in order to perform additional triangle check during cooking. This triangle check will trigger warning if too huge triangles are used. This check will ensure better simulation stability.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Scene Queries</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added PxScene::forceDynamicTreeRebuild() function to immediately rebuild the scene query structures.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Broad Phase</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed assert in debug mode that wrongly asserted when an overlap pair was removed with perfect equality between the min of one bound and the max of the other along at least one axis.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Character controller</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PxControllerFilterCallback has been added, to make CCT-vs-CCT filtering more flexible.</li>
		<li>The PxControllerBehaviorCallback was not called when a PxUserControllerHitReport was not defined. This bug has been fixed.</li>
		<li>PxObstacle notifications has been added to handle touched obstacles.</li>
		<li>Touched PxObstacle has been replaced by touched ObstacleHandle.</li>
		<li>PxObstacleContext::getObstacleByHandle has been added.</li>
		<li>Touched actors scene is checked before ride on shape, to ensure valid touched shape.</li>
		<li>Touched shape scene query flag is checked before ride on shape, to ensure valid touched shape.</li>
		<li>Touched shape user CCT filtering is triggered before ride on shape, to ensure valid touched shape.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Documented potential problem with PxVehicleWheelsDynData::getTireDrivableSurfaceType() and PxVehicleWheelsDynData::getTireDrivableSurfaceShape() whereby the pointer returned may reference a PxShape or PxMaterial that has been released in-between storing the pointer in PxVehicleUpdates and any subsequent query.</li>
		<li>PxVehicleWheelsSimData::disableWheel has been documented in more detail.  PxVehicleWheelsSimData::enableWheel has been added.</li>
		<li>A bug has been fixed where the denominator of the longitudinal slip calculation didn't take into account the value of PxTolerancesScale::length.  This will only have an impact if PxTolerancesScale::length != 1.0f.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Creating and immediately setting the position of particles failed and possibly crashed with GPU acceleration enabled. This would only happen after one or more simulation updates.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Release Notes - NVIDIA<sup>&reg;</sup> PhysX<sup>&reg;</sup> SDK 3.2.3</h1>

<h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">November 2012</h2>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.2.3</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Note: PS3 platform specific changes can be found in the PS3 readme file.</i></li>
		<li>Quaternions passed through the API are now considered valid if their magnitude is between 0.99 and 1.01.</li>
		<li>Fixed crash when running out of memory on creation of a triangle mesh.</li>
		<li>For applications using floating point exceptions, the SDK will now mask or avoid exceptions arising from invalid floating point operations (inexact and underflow exceptions may still be generated).</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug with recursive use of the PxScene read/write lock.</li>
		<li>Fixed a shutdown bug with very short lived threads on Linux platforms.</li>
		<li>PhysX version number in error messages now printed in hex for easier reading.</li>
        <li>Fixed memory barrier and prefetch implementation for all posix based platforms (android, ios, osx, linux).</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Broad Phase</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a broad phase crash bug that occurred when deleting shapes with bounds very far from the origin.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Collision Detection</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Documentation of limits of PxShape counts has been added for affected platforms.</li>
		<li>Made kinematics interact better with CCD.</li>
		<li>Adding support for disabled contact response in CCD by respecting the dominance setting.  In this case, CCD will emit events but will not alter the motion of the bodies.</li>
		<li>Fixed potential crash in eENABLE_PCM codepath.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed bug in force based contact reports. An assert could occur when PxPairFlag::eNOTIFY_THRESHOLD_FORCE_PERSISTS was set and PxPairFlag::eNOTIFY_THRESHOLD_FORCE_FOUND was not set.</li>
		<li>Twist Limit range is documented for revolute and D6 joints, and validated.</li>
		<li>Reduced the number of SDK allocations when using CCD.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Scene Queries</h4>
	<ul>
        <li>Raycasts against heighfields now return correct actual mesh index, which can be used for getTriangle().</li>
        <li>Fixed bug that caused scene queries to miss hits for static rigid bodies that got moved around (after having been added to the scene).</li>
        <li>Fixed rebuilding the dynamic structure properly when used for static rigid bodies.</li>
        <li>Fixed a rare crash in heightfield raycast code.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Character controller</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>A new runtime tessellation feature has been added, that can help reducing FPU accuracy issues in the sweep tests.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Convex hulls</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Zero-sized convex hull data double delete detection fix.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Vehicles with rigid body actors that are asleep and also have no acceleration or steer inputs are treated as though they are asleep too; that is, they are bypassed completely in the PxVehicleUpdates function.  Vehicles with sleeping rigid body actors but with non-zero acceleration or steer inputs are processed as normal in PxVehicleUpdates and will automatically have their rigid body actor woken up.</li>
		<li>New function PxVehicleSetUpdateMode to allow PxVehicleUpdates to select between applying accelerations to vehicle rigid bodies or immediate updating of their velocity.</li>
		<li> Troubleshooting guide added to the vehicles section of the PhysX Guide.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a non-deterministic crash appearing with rigid bodies using CCD and gpu particles in the same scene.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Physx Visual Debugger</h4>

		<li>Fixed a bug where the character controller could rise off the ground when hitting another character controller.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where releasing a shape of a touching actor and then releasing the character controller would crash. Releasing shapes of actors in touch may still lead to crashes in other situations. PxController::invalidateCache() can be used to work around these situations.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4> CCD </h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed culling bug in CCD sweeps with meshes with transforms that caused contacts to be missed </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The vehicle sdk used to make the assumption that wheels 0 and 1 (the front wheels) of a PxVehicleDrive4W responded positively to the input steering wheel angle, while wheels 2 and 3 (the rear wheels) responded in the opposite direction to that of the input steering wheel angle.  A consequence of this assumed behaviour was the restriction that PxVehicleWheelData::mMaxSteer was limited to positive values.  This restriction has now been relaxed with the caveat that PxVehicleWheelData::mMaxSteer must be in range (-Pi/2, Pi/2).  It is now possible to turn each wheel positively or negatively relative to the input steering wheel angle by choosing positive or negative values for PxVehicleWheelData::mMaxSteer.  Ackermann steer correction might result in the front and rear wheels competing against each other if the rear and front all steer in the same direction relative to the input steering wheel angle. If this is the case it will be necessary to set the Ackermann accuracy to zero.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to set the engine rotation speed (PxVehicleDriveDynData::setEngineRotationSpeed), the rotation speed of each wheel (PxVehicleWheelsDynData::setWheelRotationSpeed) and the rotation angle of each wheel (PxVehicleWheelsDynData::setWheelRotationAngle). The default values for each of these properties remains zero.</li>
		<li>Wheel contact reporting has been improved with the addition of a number of query functions to the PxVehicleWheelsDynData class.  These are getTireDrivableSurfaceContactPoint, getTireDrivableSurfaceContactNormal, getTireLongitudinalDir, getTireLateralDir, getSuspensionForce, getTireDrivableSurfaceShape.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to store a userData pointer per wheel.  This allows, for example, each wheel to be associated with a game object.  The relevant functions are PxVehicleWheelsDynData::setUserData and PxVehicleWheelsDynData::getUserData.</li>
		<li>The default behavior of PxVehicleWheels::setWheelShapeMapping has changed. Previously, default values were automatically assigned to each wheel at construction so that the ith wheel was mapped to the ith body shape.  This, however, made the assumption that there was a wheel shape for each wheel, which is not always true.  As a consequence, the default value is now -1, meaning any mapping between body shape and wheel has to be explictily made by calling setWheelShapeMapping.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to query the mapping between wheel and body shape with PxVehicleWheels::getWheelShapeMapping.</li>
		<li>It is now possible to query the tire shader data that has been applied to each wheel with PxVehicleWheelsDynData::getTireForceShaderData.</li>
		<li>The helper function PxVehicleComputeSprungMasses has been added to aid the setup of the suspension sprung masses from the rigid body centre of mass and wheel center coordinates.</li>
		<li>The scene query filter data applied to the suspension raycasts was previously taken from the filter data of the associated body shape.  This makes the assumption of a body shape per wheel, which is not always true.  As a consequence, the filter data must be explictly set per wheel by calling PxVehicleWheels::setSceneQueryFilterData.  The filter data can be queried with PxVehicleWheels::getSceneQueryFilterData.</li>
		<li>Sub-stepping of the vehicle update can now be applied per vehicle with PxVehicleWheelsSimData::setSubStepCount.</li>
		<li>PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceToTireFrictionPairs has been modified so that the dictionary of material pointers can be updated without the necessity of further allocation.  The create function has been replaced with separate allocate and setup functions.</li>
		<li>A new vehicle type PxVehicleNoDrive has been added to provide a close approximation to backwards compatibility with the api of the 2.8.x NxWheelShape.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Visual Remote Debugger</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added PVD compatible profile zones for batched queries.</li>
		<li>Added the ability to capture and inspect scene queries in PVD.</li>
		<li>SDK will now flush the pvd connection stream immediately after cloth or cloth fabric is created or released.</li>
        <li>Fixed the PVD support for articulations.</li>
        <li>Fixed PVD rendering wrong constraint limits.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Documentation</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrong statement in PxRigidStatic::release() has been corrected. Static rigid bodies do wake up touching dynamic rigid bodies on release.</li>
		<li>Wrong statement in PxShape::setFlag() has been corrected. It is a valid operation to clear all flags.</li>
		<li>Retroactively added more detail about changes to 3.2.1 release notes below.</li>
	</ul>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Memory leaks might get reported when using the debug versions of malloc and free together with the debug version of PhysX on Microsoft Windows platforms with Visual Studio 2010. This is caused by a bug in the Visual Studio 2010 runtime libraries. If such a leak appears immediately after releasing PhysX and all its components, please contact us for information about workarounds.</li>
		<li>Use of articulations may require an increase of 64K in the stack size for threads making API calls and engine worker threads</li>

		<li>A bug has been fixed whereby the filterData was ignored in one of the scene queries initiated by the PhysX CCT code.</li>
		<li>Introduced a more automatic mechanism for invelidating the character controller's scene cache.  As part of this, PxController::reportSceneChanged() was replaced with PxController::invalidateCache().</li>
		<li>Added helper functions PxController::get/setFootPosition() to let user specify the bottom point of the character controller, rather than the center.</li>
		<li>A new helper function, PxController::resize(), has been added to facilitate character controller resizing.</li>
		<li>PxControllerBehaviorFlag::eCCT_CAN_RIDE_ON_OBJECT is not the default behavior anymore.</li>
		<li>The slope limit is only observed when walking on static convex meshes, static triangle meshes, static boxes and static heightfields.  The slope limit is not observed when walking on dynamic or kinematic rigid bodies or static capsules or static spheres.  This partially fixes a bug where the slope limit was inadvertently considered for shapes attached to dynamic rigid bodies and inadvertently ignored for boxes attached to static shapes.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The vehicle sdk now reports an error to the error stream and exits from PxVehicleUpates if PxInitVehicleSdk has not been called in advance.  This avoids a divide-by-zero error that can arise if the vehicle sdk has not been initialised correctly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Visual Debugger</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Releasing of cloth fabrics is reported to the VRD.</li>
		<li>Ext::Joint::setActors() call now reported to PVD.</li>
		<li>Fixed crash bug when removing an aggregate containing a PxArticulation, while PVD is running.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">Release Notes - NVIDIA<sup>&reg;</sup> PhysX<sup>&reg;</sup> SDK 3.2</h1>

<h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">December 2011</h2>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.2</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Three new sample applications:  SampleCharacterCloth (character with cloth cape and cloth flags), SampleBridges (character controller walking on dynamic bridges and moving platforms), SampleCustomGravity (character controller with arbitrary up vector).</li>
		<li>On Windows, the PxFoundation instance is now a process wide singleton and part of the new PhysX3Common.dll library</li>
		<li>PxCreatePhysics() does not create a PxFoundation instance any longer. The PxFoundation instance has to be created in advance through PxCreateFoundation().</li>
		<li>Calls to PxCreatePhysics() are not valid anymore if a PxPhysics instance already exists.</li>
		<li>If profiling information should be sent to the PhysX Visual Debugger, a PxProfileZoneManager instance has to be provided when creating the PxPhysics instance.</li>
		<li>The version number constant PX_PUBLIC_FOUNDATION_VERSION has been replaced with PX_PHYSICS_VERSION. Both PxFoundation and PxPhysics use the same version number now.</li>
		<li>The API now distinguishes between input and output stream types.</li>
		<li>Added mechanism to reduce code size by not linking optional components.  See PxCreateBasePhysics() and the PxRegister*() functions.</li>
		<li>Added getConcreteTypeName() to API classes to provide run time type information.</li>
		<li>Added PxScene::getTimestamp() to retrieve the simulation counter.</li>
		<li>PxGetFoundation has been moved to PxGetFoundation.h</li>
		<li>Changed the functions PxPhysics::releaseUserReferences(), releaseCollection(), addCollection() and releaseCollected() to now take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
		<li>The signature of PxCreatePhysics has changed:  The Foundation SDK instance must be passed in explicitly.  One can also hook profiling information by passing a PxProfileZoneManager.</li>
		<li>Platform conversion for serialized data has been moved from the ConvX command line tool to the PxBinaryConverter interface in the cooking library</li>
		<li>contact data block allocation now provides statistics on usage and max usage</li>
		<li>On all platforms except PS3, contact data blocks can be progressively allocated</li>
		<li>PxExtensionVisualDebugger has been renamed to PxVisualDebuggerExt, PxExtensionsConnectionType renamed to PxVisualDebuggerConnectionFlag</li>
		<li>Default implementations of memory and file streams added in PxDefaultStreams.h</li>
		<li>Renamed PxPhysics::getMetaData() to ::PxGetSDKMetaData().</li>
		<li>Scene::simulate() now takes a memory block which is used for allocation of temporary data during simulation</li>
		<li>On Windows, CudaContextManagerDesc support appGUID now. It only works on release build. If your application employs PhysX modules that use CUDA you need to use a GUID so that patches for new architectures can be released for your game.You can obtain a GUID for your application from Nvidia.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduced a new contact generation mode, see eENABLE_PCM.  Note that this is an experimental feature that still shows simulation artifacts in some scenarios.</li>
		<li>Introduced two new friction simulation modes, see eENABLE_ONE_DIRECTIONAL_FRICTION and eENABLE_TWO_DIRECTIONAL_FRICTION.</li>
		<li>Introduced a new scene query flag PxSceneQueryFlag::eINITIAL_OVERLAP_KEEP to control how initial overhaps are treated in scene queries.</li>
		<li>Per-triangle materials have been implemented.</li>
		<li>Changes to material properties are automatically reflected in contact resolution.</li>
		<li>New helper methods to compute mass properties for a dynamic rigid body taking per shape density/mass values into account (see documentation on PxRigidBodyExt for details).</li>
		<li>A new set of methods for overlap, sweep and raycast tests based on PxGeometry objects has been introduced. See documentation on PxMeshQuery and PxGeometryQuery for details).</li>
		<li>The contact report API has changed (for details see the documentation on PxSimulationEventCallback::onContact()). Among the changes are:
		<ul>
			<li>Reports only get sent for shape pairs which request them. Previously, reports were sent for an actor pair even if the requested shape pair event was not triggered (for example because other shapes of the same actors started colliding etc.)</li>
			<li>The following PxPairFlags have been removed eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FORCES, eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FORCE_PER_POINT, eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FEATURE_INDICES_PER_POINT. Forces and feature indices are now always provided if applicable.</li>
			<li>It is much easier now to skip shape pairs or contact point information when traversing the contact report data.</li>
			<li>The memory footprint of contact reports has been reduced.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The members featureIndex0/1 of PxContactPoint have been renamed to internalFaceIndex0/1 for consistency.</li>
		<li>For trigger reports, the eNOTIFY_TOUCH_PERSISTS event has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release. For performance and flexibility reasons it is recommended to use eNOTIFY_TOUCH_FOUND and eNOTIFY_TOUCH_LOST only and manage the persistent state separately.</li>
		<li>Added PxConstraintVisualizer interface and code to visualize joint frames and limits.</li>
		<li>Improved PxBatchQuery API.</li>
		<li>PxPhysics::getProfileZoneManager() now returns a pointer rather than a reference.</li>
		<li>PxRigidDynamic::moveKinematic() has been renamed to setKinematicTarget() to underline its precise semantics.</li>
		<li>Added new function PxShape::getGeometry and class PxGeometryHolder to improve Geometry APIs.</li>
		<li>PxCreatePlane now takes a PxPlane equation as a parameter. Note that the interpretation of the distance value is negated relative to 3.1</li>

		<li>Added new functions PxTransformFromSegment, PxTransformFromPlaneEquation to simplify creation of planes and capsules.</li>
		<li>added PxJoint::getConstraint() to access the underlying constraint object, from which the constraint force can be read</li>
		<li>Some methods of PxAggregate have been renamed for consistency or replaced for extended functionality.
		<ul>
			<li>getMaxSize() is now called getMaxNbActors().</li>
			<li>getCurrentSize() is now called getNbActors().</li>
			<li>getActor() has been replaced by getActors() which copies the actor pointers to a user buffer.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Added support for kinematic triangle meshes, planes and heighfields.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Scene queries</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Dynamic AABBTree has been set as the default dynamic pruning structure.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed descriptors from particle API: The properties maxParticles and PxParticleBaseFlag::ePER_PARTICLE_REST_OFFSET need to be specified when calling PxPhysics::createParticleSystem() and createParticleFluid(). All other properties can be adjusted after creation through set methods.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Cloth</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added convex collision shapes, see PxCloth::addCollisionConvex()</li>

		<li>Added angle based bending constraints, see PxClothPhaseSolverConfig::SolverType::eBENDING</li>
		<li>Added separation constraints, a spherical volume that particles should stay outside of, see PxCloth::setSeparationConstraints()</li>
		<li>Added drag, see PxCloth::setDragCoefficient()</li>
		<li>Added inertia scaling, controls how much movement due to PxCloth::setTargetPose() will affect the cloth</li>
		<li>Added support for setting particle previous positions, see PxCloth::setParticles()</li>
		<li>Added controls for scaling particle mass during collision, this can help reduce edge stretching around joints on characters, see PxCloth::setCollisionMassScale()</li>
		<li>Particle data is now copied asynchronously from the GPU after simulate (rather than on demand)</li>
		<li>Improved fabric layout, you can now share fabric data across multiple phases to reduce memory usage, see PxClothFabric</li>
		<li>Fixed bug in collision when capsules are tapered at a slope > 1</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added PxVehicleDriveTank, a vehicle class that enables tank behaviors.</li>
		<li>Support for vehicles with more than 4 wheels, see PxVehicleDrive4W, PxVehicleDriveTank.</li>
		<li>Significant refactor of vehicle api to allow further types of vehicle to be added.</li>
		<li>Americal English spelling used in vehicle api.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4W replaced with PxVehicleDrive4W, PxVehicle4WSimulationData replaced with PxVehicleDriveSimData4W.</li>
		<li>Removal of scene query helper functions and structs: PxVehicle4WSceneQueryData, PxVehicle4WSetUpSceneQuery, PxWheelRaycastPreFilter, PxSetupDrivableShapeQueryFilterData, PxSetupNonDrivableShapeQueryFilterData, PxSetupVehicleShapeQueryFilterData. See SampleVehicle_SceneQuery.h for their implementation in SampleVehicle.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4WSimpleSetup and PxCreateVehicle4WSimulationData have been removed and replaced with default values in vehicle components, see PxVehicleComponents.h.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4WTelemetryData has been replaced with PxVehicleTelemetryData, a class that supports vehicles with any number of wheels, see PxVehicleTelemetryData</li>
		<li>PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceType no longer stored in PxMaterial::userData.  A hash table of PxMaterial pointers is instead used to associate each PxMaterial with a PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceType, see PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceToTireFrictionPairs.</li>
		<li>PxVehicleTyreData::mLongitudinalStiffness has been replaced with PxVehicleTireData::mLongitudinalStiffnessPerUnitGravity, see PxVehicleTireData.</li>
		<li>Tire forces now computed from a shader to allow user-specified tire force functions, see PxVehicleTireForceCalculator.</li>
		<li>Added helper functions to quickly configure 3-wheeled cars, see PxVehicle4WEnable3WTadpoleMode, PxVehicle4WEnable3WDeltaMode.</li>
	</ul>

    <h4>Serialization</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the functions PxPhysics::releaseUserReferences(), releaseCollection(), addCollection() and releaseCollected() to now take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
		<li>Platform conversion for serialized data has been moved from the ConvX command line tool to the PxBinaryConverter interface in the cooking library.</li>
		<li>Changed some functions in RepXUtility.h and RepX.h to take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
    </ul>


	<h4>What we removed:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Deformables have been removed. Use the optimized solution for clothing simulation instead (see documentation on PxCloth for details).</li>
		<li>PxSweepCache is deprecated.</li>
		<li>PVD is no longer enabled in the release build.</li>
		<li>Removed anisotropic friction.</li>
		<li>Removed the CCD mode eSWEPT_CONTACT_PAIRS.</li>
		<li>PxActorDesc has been removed.</li>
		<li>The ConvX tool has been removed.</li>
		<li>Removed empty default implementations of functions in PxSimulationEventCallback for consistency and because it can create bugs in user code if function prototypes change between releases.  Users must now supply (eventually blank) implementations for all functions.</li>
		<li>Octree and quadtree pruning structures have been removed.</li>
		<li>PxScene.overlapAny has been removed. overlapMultiple with maxNumHits 1 does the same.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Fixed Bugs</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PxScene::getActors() might not work properly when the startIndex parameter is used.</li>
		<li>Improved the doc-comment of PxConvexMesh::getMassInformation().</li>
        <li>RepX instantiation can lose all internal references when addOriginalIdsToObjectMap is false.</li>
        <li>PxSetGroup crashed when used on a compound.</li>
        <li>PhysXCommon.dll can be delay loaded.</li>
        <li>ContactReportStream can now handle huge report numbers and size (resize-able flag) can be set in PxSceneDesc.h.</li>
        <li>Fixed assert in sweep tests.</li>
		<li>Concurrent read/write operations during a PxScene::fetchResults() call were not detected properly and no warning message got sent in checked builds. Forbidden write operations during callbacks triggered by PxScene::fetchResults() (contact/trigger reports etc.) were not covered either.</li>
        <li>Fixed crash bug that occurred during collision detection when more than 16K of contact data was generated.  Contacts that generate more than 16K of contact data are now fully supported.</li>
		<li>Fixed crash bug when PhysX Visual Debugger is connected and an object gets modified and then released while the simulation is running.</li>
	</ul>

<h2><br>
<a name="knownissues320">Known Issues And Limitations</a></h2>

<blockquote>

	<h4>Binary Serialization</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Meta data generation for PxParticleFluid and PxParticleSystem serializables currently fails.</li>
		<li>For collections that contain jointed rigid bodies all corresponding joints need to be added as well, otherwise deserialization will fail.
	</ul>
	<h4>Rigid Body Simulation</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Capsules and spheres can struggle to come to rest on even perfectly flat surfaces. To ensure these objects come to rest, it is necessary to increase angular damping on rigid bodies made of these shapes. In addition, flagging the capsule/sphere's material with physx::PxMaterialFlag::eDISABLE_STRONG_FRICTION can help bring these shapes to rest.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Character Cloth Sample</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>An NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 2.0 or higher is required for GPU accelerated simulation in the SampleCharacterCloth sample, if no such device is present then simulation will be performed on the CPU.</li>
		<li>Note that this is not a general SDK requirement, the clothing SDK supports cards with Compute Capability < 2.0 but with limitations on mesh size.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Character Controller</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Releasing shapes of actors that are in touch with a character controller may lead to crashes. Releasing whole actors doesn't lead to the same problems. PxController::invalidateCache() can be used to work around these issues.</li>
	</ul>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Under VC10, you may get warnings due to conflicting build configuration flags.  Workaround: Clear the "Inherit from parent or project defaults" flag for all projects in Project->Properties->C/C++->Command Line.  We plan to fix this for the 3.1 general availability release.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Scene Query</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Querying the scene (e.g. using raycastSingle()) from multiple threads simultaneously is not safe.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Cloth</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Even simple parameters of a PxCloth can not be set or accessed while the simulation is running.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>RepX</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>RepX fails to load elements of aggregate joint parameters (PxD6JointDrive etc.)</li>
	</ul>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.0</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>

	This third major version of the SDK is a significant rewrite of the entire technology.  We did away with a large amount of legacy clutter and replaced them with a wealth of new features and improvements.
	Because even the API changes are so significant, it is easier to see it as a whole new product rather than a long list of changes.

	<h4>What we removed:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The dedicated NVIDIA PhysX PPU hardware is not supported any more.</li>
		<li>Scene compartments are not supported anymore. All created physical objects are now part of one and the same compartment.</li>
		<li>Force fields are not part of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK anymore.</li>
		<li>Splitting a simulation timestep into multiple substeps is not a functionality of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK any longer and has to be implemented above the SDK.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Key new features:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Articulations: A way to create very stiff joint assemblies.</li>
		<li>Serialization: Save objects in a binary format and load them back quickly!</li>
		<li>Broad Phase Clustering: Put objects that belong together into a single broadphase volume.</li>
		<li>Driverless Model: No need to worry about system software on PC anymore.</li>
		<li>Dynamic Character Controller: A character controller that can robustly walk on dynamic objects.</li>
		<li>Vehicle Library: A toolkit to make vehicles, including an all new tire model.</li>
		<li>Non-Simulation Objects: A staging are outside of the simulation from where you can add things into the simulation at high speed.</li>
		<li>Simulation Task Manager: Take control of the management of simulation tasks.</li>
		<li>Stable Depenetration: Large penetrations can be gracefully recovered from.</li>
		<li>Double Buffering: You can read from and write to the simulated objects while the simulation is running on another thread.</li>
		<li>Mesh Scaling: Create different nonuniformly scaled instances of your meshes and convexes without duplicating the memory.</li>
		<li>Distance Based Collision Detection: Have the simulation create contacts before objects touch, and do away with unsightly overlaps.</li>
		<li>Fast Continuous Collision Detection: Have small and high speed objects collide correctly without sacrificing performance.</li>
		<li>Significantly increased performance and memory footprint, especially on consoles.</li>
		<li>Unified solver for deformables and rigid bodies for great interaction.</li>
		<li>Triangle collision detection with deformables.</li>
		<li>Support for our new Physics Visual Debugger, including integrated profiling.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Math classes</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Matrix based transforms have been replaced by quaternions.</li>
		<li>All angles are now expressed in radians. IN PARTICULAR the PxQuat constructor from
			axis and angle as well as the getAngleAxis and fromAngleAxis methods now use radians rather than degrees.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Capsules are now defined to extend along the x rather than the y axis.</li>
		<li>Triangle meshes do not support heightfield functionality anymore. Use the dedicated PxHeightField class instead.</li>
		<li>Dynamic triangle mesh actors are not supported any longer. However, you can decompose your mesh into convex parts and create a dynamic actor consisting of these convex parts.</li>
		<li>The deprecated heightfield property NxHeightFieldDesc::verticalExtent is not supported any longer. Please use the PxHeightFieldDesc::thickness parameter instead.</li>
		<li>NxSpringAndDamperEffector is not supported anymore. Use PxDistanceJoint instead.</li>
		<li>Joints are now part of the PhysX extensions library (PhysXExtensions).</li>
		<li>Wheel shapes have been replaced by the more flexible entity PxWheel. A default wheel implementation, encapsulating most of the old wheel functionality, can be found in the PhysX extensions library (see PxDefaultWheel).</li>
		<li>The NxUtilLib library has been removed. Sweep/overlap/raycast tests and other helper methods can be found in the new GeomUtils library.</li>
		<li>Materials can no longer be accessed through indices. Per triangle material meshes need a material table which can be specified per shape (see PxShape::setMaterials() for details).</li>
		<li>The default material is not available anymore.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particle Systems, Particle Fluids</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The NxFluid class has been replaced with two classes for separation of functionality and ease of use.
			<ul>
				<li>PxParticleSystem: Particles colliding against the scene.</li>
				<li>PxParticleFluid: Particles simulating a fluid (sph).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Simplified parameterization for particle systems.
			<ul>
				<li>Using absolute distances instead of relative multipliers to rest spacing</li>
				<li>Simplified sph parameters</li>
				<li>Unified collision parameters with deformable and rigid body features</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Creating and releasing particles is now fully controlled by the application.
			<ul>
				<li>Particle lifetime management isn't provided through the SDK anymore.</li>
				<li>Emitters have been removed from the SDK.</li>
				<li>Drain shapes don't cause particles to be deleted directly, but to be flagged instead.</li>
				<li>Initial particle creation from the particle system descriptor isn't supported anymore.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Particle data buffer handling has been moved to the SDK.</li>
		<li>Per particle collision rest offset.</li>
		<li>GPU accelerated particle systems.
			<ul>
				<li>Application controllable mesh mirroring to device memory.</li>
				<li>Runtime switching between software and GPU accelerated implementation.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

<a name="knownissues300">Known Issues And Limitations</a></h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Adding or removing a PxAggregate object to the scene is not possible while the simulation is running.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Particle Systems</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Releasing the Physics SDK may result in a crash when using GPU accelerated particle systems. </br>
		This can be avoided by doing the following before releasing the Physics SDK:
			<ul>
				<li>Releasing the PxScene objects that contain the GPU accelerated particle systems.</li>
				<li>Releasing application mirrored meshes by calling PxPhysicsGpu::releaseTriangleMeshMirror(...), PxPhysicsGpu::releaseHeightFieldMirror(...) or PxPhysicsGpu::releaseConvexMeshMirror(...).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
